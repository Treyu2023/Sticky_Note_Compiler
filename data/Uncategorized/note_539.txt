FP7 I put into standalone and tested all blend grades. The Premium meter check valve was faulty allowing reg to flow into the premium line. I replaced and tested the premium meter check valve.

I was able to clean the door nodes with alcohol and clean the plug connectors. On reboot the issue cleared up, I tested dispensing on FP9.

The only damage seemed to be to the power supply. I only had a power supply for an EDH1. I had to get a complete EDH2 , because the components could not be tested without power. On return I was able to recover the system with the power supply. I recommend replacing the EDH after the leak is fixed. For now the site is running & I was able to get the reports and a snapshot backup of the system to safeguard in the event the site has any issues this will facilitate and assist repairs. All test ok.
