I power cycled dispenser 1/2 (EN00200290) and checked the OMNIA settings. Once power restored the card reader and screen worked properly. Its likely that the power went out and caused the issue. All that was required was a stable power cycle. I tested EMV Debit transaction. I went over with the owner what he should do next time this issue occurs. All test ok.=a079b9c1-665f-4075-a35d-43798e3249b4 =71679a16-1ad1-4a84-8822-7145d3294277 11-12 41 miles=ff1b51de-cc7b-4b54-88d8-8fd0ce7dbaf0 12-13.5=7407fb2e-0edb-406a-9ff0-a73c75e04a9a 230131-0338=edf2c264-a24c-40fd-9e87-9c543ffc454b PO - 1-5498672242 =bb9f4387-d93e-49d2-9ae5-15e7e8ce8685 711 #41365=7d103380-e2ed-4433-8070-068abf5134f7 4501 old Burlington RD=732536d7-b208-489a-b78c-241b0c60be81 4400 burlington rd=02a15242-cf2a-4444-9d8c-d5640bc25c18 Greensboro=49c35552-796d-49c2-90cc-36673fc3f7ba =d321a2da-c973-4193-ac74-2dfbcd49c289 Arrived on-site, checked in with Vixxo app and MOD. The manager stated that she did not know of any issues with the printer I reseated the cable (Toshiba 73Y1104) the other cable plugged into the printer goes to the MX915 PIN Pad terminal block device (Verifone 26838-02-R).  Reports have been printing normally including this morning. When I viewed the printers in windows it was showing the OKIDATA Microline 186 in an error state This is a separate printer from the report/receipt printer. I traced the cable out and found it buried under the counter. The manager stated she has never used this printer. The oldest document in the printer que was from the 26th of last month. The printer had no paper loaded in it and a red alarm light on its face. I loaded a sheet of paper in it and the alarm went away. I checked the fiscal register printersettings and the error cleared from there aswell.

I checked the Veeder root and found Tank 2 (8K) and 3 (6k) manifolded were showing a CSLD leak rate of +0.17 GPH and tank 2 was showing .78 inches of water. I checked the vant cap, the Vapor recovery, probe and fill caps for tightness. I checked the copper tubing between the manifold and venture in the STP sump and found that when I disconnected the line I was getting a small amount of fuel to drip from the venture side. This is an indication that the siphon check valve is not holding. I had to run to the shop to get a replacement. I returned to the site and installed the Siphon check valve. It will likely take a few days before the alarm will clear due to the nature of CSLD. All check ok. =d6ab5c6c-fe91-43ba-9f4c-55a1282968e7 =91065496-0dd8-4f6d-9ada-76613b598a5e =ab736ce5-c9c5-4a5f-96e7-9f3ed1ea7d30 =238ed22d-d8a0-4f09-939e-301953911cec =eb6d4a37-dbba-44f4-a341-0d4b85d95201 =ab0f0dcc-e424-4a4d-852e-8c43e7ceac3c =e495868c-1d2e-45d7-a4b1-7a2ffb6690fd =106db3c3-a0aa-40df-b64f-022b40b74d19
