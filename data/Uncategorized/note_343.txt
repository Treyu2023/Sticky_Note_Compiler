Initially, we experienced difficulty in locating the keys but they were later found in the office by the manager. I replaced the EPP, activated and performed an RKL (Remote Key Loading). Despite this, the screen still displayed a keypad with an 'x', indicating a malfunction. I attempted to rectify this issue by replacing the FCB (Field Control Board), but it proved unsuccessful. Neither the EPP nor the FCB responded, hindering the keypad activation or menu access. It appears either the EPP or FCB is non-operational. A revisit is required for further troubleshooting and part replacement. The task has been classified as 'Requires Revisit'.=de0accbf-3f51-48a6-be5d-a77c08c35b84 =7a3a3513-1bfb-4c59-a3a1-7c59b35ba28c 13.5-14 25 miles=a6459bcd-2482-453e-8d9f-592312d5861b 14-15.5=9826f2b8-369f-4a61-af11-ef24c119c636 15.5-16.5 40 miles=22f99ea9-a319-4242-abd7-6dbb6278f4de PO - 2426775=0d67788e-fcac-4603-ae34-48312c79e5da CV Exxon=9ad15819-af95-4f2c-9503-0371a52cbe15 1864 N Church St=ce015306-99d4-4131-a5ed-bd11284fd2c6 =c3061665-62de-487e-a28b-e879940639b7 Upon arrival on-site, I proceeded with the customary check-in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). The issue at hand involved the TLS 30, which was repeatedly running the 'warm start system self test' on its display. I attempted to address the problem by reseating all the boards in the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) and reinstalling the software module on the CPU board. However, none of these steps halted the cyclical warm-start process when the system was powered on.=18fdfede-a8d2-4c7e-bb05-db8d1b80c348 =dc52ef72-5b00-420f-b61b-f343bb859268 Unfortunately, the ATG's configuration prevented me from bypassing it to restart fueling at the site. A constant operation of the motors would be the only workaround for this issue under the present circumstances. To further complicate the situation, the pump sense and relay configurations, vital for the reprogramming of the TLS, were not listed in any of the 10-year-old printouts.=9a24a9b1-8d88-438c-b066-3e0e026a99de =547d0f42-3dc3-402d-bfb0-30885d8e0342 Our resources in the area only included ECPU2 upgrade kits. Therefore, I coordinated with Mark from REO to get approval from the owner to proceed with the replacement. The Raleigh team will be dispatching the necessary parts for installation early tomorrow morning.=52ba7f18-ef60-4b9c-949f-a9a57e543319 =aff27f90-95fa-4553-8600-8dedfc5ad996 All work for the current visit is complete. I will return with the required parts for the next stage of troubleshooting and repair.=2ca91bfb-80d4-4b56-be6c-413f1b939ce8 =2bf0cc29-6126-4b3a-8fc4-11e306028262 =30b54aad-a3ac-4010-bc6d-eea2f3187435 =47b3ac21-427d-412a-904a-ea97d09aa1fc =055246cb-315f-415c-9bd2-3842a9f972e0
