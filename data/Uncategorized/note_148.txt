Site has Wayne Ovation dispensers.I notified my admin team of this and they coordinated with jobber to create a separate ticket for a Wayne service provider to address this issue. I troubleshot the Dover box to find it was not getting internet. I determined that this was due to the Mako box primary connection being down, causing the 4G backup to kick in. This works for most devices, but the mako will turn off internet access to what it considers to be non essential devices, I.E. the dover remote access pc. Once I troubleshot the issue and restored internet to the Mako and the Dover box. I contacted Simmons technical support and had their rep remotely access the site and verify that the commander and ATG were both connected and all applications were reset to ensure full functionality.

The site has 3 STP's 2 regular and one Premium. I could not find anything wrong with the premium from the back room, but one of the regulars (previously Plus) was getting voltage but no amperage. I shut off the breaker to the Previously Plus STP. I went outside and this is when I found out that in fact it was one of two regulars. I grabbed a can and went down the line of dispensers testing each of them to identify which one was fed by this motor. When testing FP 1/2 I found that it would pump 15 cents and then it threw error code 5047 (reverse flow detected) in the plus and premium PPU windows. This is likely due to inactivity depressurization before or during a power outtage or reset of the dispensers. this will allow the premium to be pressurized in reverse by the regular the frst time it is used once power was restored and this in turn orients the pulser to think that is the forward direction. To remedy this issue I simply power cycled the dispenser and pumped mid grade as to orient both pulsers in the proper direction.
