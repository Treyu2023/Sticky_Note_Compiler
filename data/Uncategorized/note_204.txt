As part of our troubleshooting process, we attached a clear hose to the siphon line. The continuous presence of air bubbles emerging from the siphon bar pointed towards either a leak in the system or the connection not being positioned at the highest point in the line.=9cfde070-9661-4f48-8abf-e5bfb544c270 =04e671b7-4c4e-4c6e-9108-cc2582554c5e In our observations, we also noted that the vent cap seemed to lack a rain guard. This situation could potentially allow the vent cap to accumulate rainwater. Considering the use of ethanol fuel at this site, it's possible that this water wouldn't build up but rather mix in with the fuel.=b05daa3d-518c-499f-bf51-89d791304a1d =3793c646-cb9f-4e70-b1a9-2ac040fb3e6c At the moment, all the necessary work has been completed, and I'm categorizing the call as incomplete due to the potential outstanding issues that may need further inspection or intervention.=1e4f65d9-d275-45d6-a77a-98ba342a1e1e =0d71251c-5728-4681-9c9c-4f7834b2d1d8 15.25-15.75 15 miles=7324cdbf-c49a-484b-949d-78b6e785c2d5 15.75-16.5=fa810025-1a1f-45c2-b912-3154dab1f702 SC0027=f6d45449-2f62-4fe2-8dfa-51cc79a38557 Joe's Quick Marts=2e794b04-5106-43af-be51-c68093b69f52 8620 dorchester rd=f81aaaa3-b376-4a9e-9d4d-fa90efff0847 North Charleston SC 29420=3593d91f-a2af-4e7f-9956-7c8be13c5e5d =2d03b748-5992-4c26-b314-2d224097f892 Arrived on-site, ddelivered part to antwon and assisted with installation of part.

To begin troubleshooting, I set dispenser 1 to standalone mode and conducted several tests on each fuel grade, including the blend grade. Despite my efforts, I was unable to reproduce the reported issue.=e0b6a6fe-cfa9-45d4-b0dc-28e2f930b1a9 =2f54c9ef-b57e-4c41-90c1-6bd33f90647a For additional diagnostic information, I extracted the dispenser logs from the Pump Control Node (PCN). I also updated the system time, which was inaccurately lagging by more than a day. The logs revealed communication loss on side A, corresponding to Fuel Pump 1 (FP1).=475f6100-3fb9-439d-8ff0-7de69de50fb2 =16b34dcb-39c5-4502-b1f6-0d2a398b210a Upon inspecting side B, corresponding to Fuel Pump 2 (FP2), I noticed a key left in the lock of the upper door. Furthermore, I identified discrepancies in the door node models between the two sides: Side B has a Door Node 4, whereas Side A utilizes a Door Node 5. This difference could potentially lead to the observed intermittent communication issues.=03d10d73-0cef-4a86-a9f1-f3de0ca2ed9d =1c5f2159-5b2d-4a59-b370-1c70f64bbeef To address these issues, I plan to order a Door Node 5 upgrade kit for dispenser 2, including the Door Node 5, Pump Price Units (PPU's), and associated cabling. This upgrade aims to prevent compatibility issues moving forward.=1c545f36-e5e6-4bb0-b6eb-8000f464f370 =af4aaa80-59f8-4413-942e-ed708532260b Next, I utilized the BRCM tool from inside the facility, which updated the (SSoMs). However, I noticed that only the SSoM in the BRCM had been updated previously. Running the diagnostics from the BRCM highlighted communication issues with one of the dispensers, which was flagged in red. I have attached relevant images for reference.=8dc1ba24-bc52-426c-91f5-31af5543bdac =d92f49d3-6050-4bfd-a9b7-3e6710569f67 To ensure software consistency, I updated the software on both door nodes and the pump node for dispenser 1 and 2 to the latest version. However, due to hardware differences, they cannot run identical software versions.=4ff33bd2-e524-4685-9141-e98823841ff1 =dab2a331-cdf0-48f8-929c-21bc43561e42 Given the intermittent nature of the issue and the infrequency of logged events (only one or two every few days), I opted to unbag the dispenser while we await the necessary parts for further intervention.=9f079f7f-5d82-4a40-8624-900f5f23a984 columbiadispatch@guardianfueltech.com=d2ae0ed9-84c7-452e-bef6-f17c75443c2b =29bd9421-7a08-4fd9-b604-5eb7ef8cc55b =de4ccc23-1b87-4faf-b1aa-845e6f81eaaf =f1b0d3e8-84f8-428d-bc97-caa2f2ebed05 =ae5b214c-e386-41d2-aa7c-15f49e01e171 =cfb53f1b-5e91-4914-a4a1-4d8f9c96901a =6c696aad-1e7a-4be6-be19-d7795158dda0
