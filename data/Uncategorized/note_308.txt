However, dispenser numbers 3 & 4 also required a replacement of the DCM 2.2. After successfully replacing and resolving all issues, we began to close everything up in preparation to reopen the site, but unfortunately, we encountered processing issues with the card readers.=71365bb6-0be0-4cb9-994a-9e8bc18cb468 =cd1e664d-73cf-4e77-a773-9d98f2335da6 We were able to largely rectify this issue by purging and recovering the card readers. The regular pumping unit for dispenser numbers 1 & 2 also required a replacement of the belt due to wear. We replaced the FCI board, bringing the total part replacements on this ticket to:=3310e6a6-3e29-49b7-86b9-ae0e36ac69c1 =fa86a411-670d-4af4-8d21-71dd41b85e3b 2 x DCM 2.2=ec8aee4c-bdbd-48cb-94c3-689ffae06431 1 x FCI Current Loop Board=022b512b-5af0-4a5c-9a25-bf8061417916 1 x BRCM 2 Cover (Homeplug)=54a997c4-d36b-4d13-89f7-2a49b1e489e6 1 x BRCM 2 Field Wiring Board=24ed8a46-a4c0-4bbc-ba8c-d28c2f3d3b36 1 x Belt=3af9d0fa-3796-4b57-9018-407a9af2c6f8 In terms of labor, this included pulling new wires to dispenser numbers 1 & 2 as well as removing the dispenser from the island to facilitate this.=ad62d3b4-7eeb-4a99-a256-dc71eef87eb9 =35d376eb-bf12-4eca-92b0-65b563197b5f The extent of damaged equipment observed in this case is generally consistent with what one would expect to see in the aftermath of a power surge or lightning strike.
