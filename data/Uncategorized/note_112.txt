It was necessary to shut down the forecourt to replace the faulty parts in the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG). Following this, I proceeded to swap the parts and manually program the unit.=c1023358-a40b-4ff0-ad4e-32a0162b68c2 =b850a504-47a2-4de5-abac-cc66e69560c7 Upon completion, I contacted James from Handee Hugos and confirmed successful polling of data from the ATG with the original Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) card. I then printed out the new setup and included it with the old setup in the unit, as a precautionary measure.=c2224dd9-a0a4-4090-a194-42deb9b21a5a =f474bdcc-b8b7-401e-b321-a910296015b8 Subsequently, I re-opened the forecourt and carefully observed customers fueling to ensure that the system was fully operational. All tests conducted during this process yielded satisfactory results.=41cdb463-cc68-40c3-aa2c-14193085b8cc =97c693fb-8d5e-4df7-b362-73d9b186f0fa =7cdf579c-b7b0-4b2b-aa61-d9720d16519d 13.75-15 65 miles=b737d6f8-cafe-4074-a946-6249dbadbaf9 15-16.5=6173640c-dc0b-4687-81f5-81ec64abb51e 16.5-17=444a59c1-37b9-4893-ae90-4590eb0b89b7 =3c53d7fe-4b2a-4edd-aaba-fea605cde42d Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the MOD and observed that the Encore 300 dispenser was displaying an error code of 31 in the PPU's, indicating bad totals. To resolve the issue, I cleared the totals and performed a cold start of the dispenser as I was unable to access the programming. Following this, I proceeded to program the dispenser and conducted calibration on both sides. While attempting to re-enter the programming, I encountered the 26 error codes, which indicated a calibration error after. Upon further investigation, it became evident that the PCN/Logic board was malfunctioning, and a replacement (M01598A001) was required. Accordingly, I have placed a call for the required parts and will return to the site as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I have placed a hold on the call for required parts.
