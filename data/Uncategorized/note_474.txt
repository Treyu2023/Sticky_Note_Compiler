I checked the event viewer on the Passport and found that the backup drive was not being detected by the system. I replaced the backup drive with a WD Blue 500 GB SSD. While trying to run the Fixbackupdrive command I kept getting errors that were misleading and confusing, at this point I contacted TAC and Toby assisted me with an alternate procedure for replacing/restoring the backup drive. While he was in the system we looked at the global store database settings and associated files. The settings are correct and do not explain the size of the .DAT file being 1.8GB (under normal circumstances the size should be 100-400MB). This will cause the system to slow down and can only be corrected by pulling an extraction of just what is needed and clean imaging the server and pushing the extraction back in. the site is running version 12.02, this should be corrected before they upgrade the software because migrating a snapshot would carry over this file. It is possible that this is why the file is that bloated to begin with, it was either carried over from older version with incorrect settings or there is/was corruption in the system before they migrated to 12.02. I informed the cashier, but the owner needs to be aware of this and schedule repairs. After we corrected the backup drive issue I was able to pull a snapshot and see the backup drive normally. The DAT file issue is a potential cause of the backup drive failure. All test ok.=b4e80f64-52f9-46c1-887c-6921042a1e84 =c0749d8e-2dce-429a-889b-019d0244a2dd =9b890927-9fc4-41f5-8477-33f3f4d35ed6 12.5-13.5 45miles=e41091f9-ca46-49d2-903e-e72e4393f4fa 13.75-14.5=c4315823-01bb-4331-b41b-d9ce3cf41900 14.5-16DH 72 miles=0f945a8d-9f8b-42ca-b9b0-12aeb5aa0bbf 221229-0020=bc7f5245-2835-41e8-bf88-0190de24e41a Kathy's Mini Mart=de9c0ab6-da01-49cd-a588-e1d91845e936 936 Washington Street=7c08a9df-c384-4f52-b5fa-8a0011c3e77f Eden=15fa16f0-c413-4f6d-9251-2d5c96711cd2 =9a37d109-c4a0-4236-9f0e-fe383c62c893 Arrived on-stie, checked in with MOD.
