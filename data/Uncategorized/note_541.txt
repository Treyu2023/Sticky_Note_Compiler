The site was temporarily closed for a scheduled audit. During the course of my work, I needed to reset the manager's password within the configuration client. Upon further examination, I discovered a few discrepancies in the settings, including the 'outside' option being improperly configured for each car wash PLU selection. This configuration issue would have prevented the car wash options from being displayed on the card readers at the fuel pumps. Unfortunately the car was is out of service and I believe that is why it is still not prompting for credit or debit at the dispensers. =6f1fcdf8-ae18-486b-ae34-962edd9f3d4a =0a7c1f62-5a2e-4cd1-bf3b-c2af0188c18c Already on-site, confirmed that the loyalty is working. =02b9dbb4-2437-40e5-b5c1-71f75afb454a =cf52aff6-f8d2-47ad-8b2a-65f73d513ee5 =f883dd80-e01d-4a22-99d7-78ccb0798d6e While already present at the location, I observed that the breakaway was pre-connected. I proceeded to conduct tests on the two fuel pumps with protective covers, identifying a malfunctioning breakaway on Fuel Pump 5. Subsequently, I replaced the faulty breakaway and conducted additional tests, confirming that all components were functioning properly and efficiently.=355ec935-fd49-4666-9a10-b5473427121e =a022d887-c3e9-486e-9593-a9881701fa8c =dff640a5-c8f1-4fe3-90fb-adfc1bdb49c5 14.75-15.5=74a27255-b4ae-48d1-9b8c-8e8c7fdccab0 15.5-16.5=90ac8e41-8aec-4e21-9e06-65cab05f7b13 16.5-18.5 100 miles=16a918ff-7c22-4cb7-9fc8-7e3cf7130d1f =17581e61-3197-491f-a87a-a54e35340a4a 230508-0316=e0519677-0e99-4f96-aaf1-9b8d9880fc2d FWKD5625840=32534449-c9a6-4ba5-8912-3c18c1a9426e 711 35570=876a5797-612d-4ae3-bf45-90eb9ea4eedc 5455 Brookshire BLVD=b0df0605-15d2-4336-a516-459eb9a7c5e5 Charlotte=6a4136d4-49d1-42a8-a169-299d0d7d1632 =3703b5e5-e8ce-4204-98c5-cd56f5fa7a04 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and with Service Now portal. I found that both the server and client printers were experiencing operational issues. To resolve this, I disabled USB COM Port 20 in the device manager and rebooted the system. Following the reboot, I conducted tests on both printers to ensure they were functioning correctly. All tests were successful, indicating that the issue had been resolved.=1baa709b-b667-427e-9dcb-8044ed1e1121 =ed499604-5643-432f-b9ac-5ffd28390db2 =d63296db-ad7c-4611-983f-436d04f04d64 =34b95c81-4ea2-419a-97de-013f9c56ac5e =96ff82c5-ec56-4559-a370-6e24fbb4e2ed =51eb2de5-4a2d-49c0-bf1c-5833af0d450f =3e133fd4-c010-4ebc-9897-d5b5397a52d4 =1dbbc8cd-cd53-471d-83ca-9958bbd6f654 =dce278cc-2742-4770-8bf4-3d3f006e6952 =e70d3e34-5a28-430c-bb02-8202f9399999 =03776c32-6a77-405e-a378-96a15b6b0917 =deed5b42-5a52-40a4-b324-a188f83f5844 =08bfd222-0902-4812-bd02-4114a92ceb65 =61d6820e-5422-44b6-9517-5d60d8f7871d =d2d01f4c-5d99-449d-a774-5a4ec50b65cc =57465768-b3f9-40c7-b95f-1f86130dbe08 =cf9d9d3a-1009-4007-a6a5-f390d9c99134 =21d213db-9ddc-4fa0-bf01-f4ac640f0c11 =5095e032-944e-4357-91d4-35cbae7b8e3e =78e3f176-a61f-42a7-b846-79b6c9af420d =c7c1a693-cfaf-4420-a1a1-2ca8a4673dbf -
