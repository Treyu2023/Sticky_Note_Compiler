I checked all the boards in the ca5rd tray and either something was unplugged or corrosion on the cables was giving a bazd connection because when I re-installed the old Hydraulic interface I started getting my hook signal voltage.

Installed the A/C input module and power supply replacement ordered and re-assembled the TLS-350. The Power supply that was ordered (2nd one) due to the faulty A/C input was DOA and would not power the screens. I believe the only thing this needs at this point is another power supply board. All work complete until parts arrive.=00f0dba5-7878-4cd0-b160-2b7983489b53 =9a09390f-8c3a-45b9-aed3-051b6db110bc =7ea2c9ba-0363-4eba-a99f-9ed036318eea
