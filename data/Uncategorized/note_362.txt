I traced out and checked continuity of the ethernet cable to pin pad on register 1. I removed the serial block and ran the cable directly to the pinpad. I tested connection on different ports within the same VPN block on the managed switch. I contacted race track store support and performed basic troubleshooting steps. NCR is dispatched to install a new pen pad.

Checked in on SN and with MOD.  FP3 someone forced entry which bound the lock. That's why the site broke key. FP1 had been tempered as well and the premium pulser had been rigged. Luckily the poll's reports were not stolen. I was able to repair both locks and the pulser on FB1. I. I checked all the dispensers for tamper and cleared several printer jams. Put fresh security labels on all feeling positions.
