I ran diagnostics & chips would read, they would not read in running mode. I tried reloading Viper Pay software before replacing the PIN Pad. I replaced the MX925 and ordered a debit key. Once I upgraded the software and injected the key I found the port setting copied from other PIN Pad was wrong. This caused a similar issue so I tried correcting the original pin pad before eventually swapping it with the new one still for the se issue. Tested contact and contactless emv transactions. All test ok.=localId_ab75bd5404924dc7a9518b7761b15ec6 =localId_6f1b18372c97408080585263e0cb6ddd =localId_aeb1c57c050e4b0d807432e758e34265 20-21.5=localId_53f95bfe73ec44e8a50631edb4693d82 21.5-22.25=localId_fdf15510de774e9aa13d722719b6de02 22.25-23=localId_d1c683360f4c492ab5bdcbd2c5408b64 FWKD4371240=localId_1cbb44b88afb4225a9c82d66e799387f 711=localId_ad6f7aa8cc9042ada84a776b30b61fb2 =localId_139692c716084c379158f443e30854af Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The Passport has windows errors & will need to be re-imaged at the least. The RV042 router is dead. When I launched SYS Recovery mode, SQL server is not functioning and I am unable to see and backup data. Without the RV042 in place I can not access the EDH or obtain a copy of the SMR. Will have to return in the morning once I get the RV042 router. All test ok. Pending parts.
