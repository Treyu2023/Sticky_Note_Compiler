Through my investigation, I discovered a lack of power being supplied to the FCI (Fuel Control Interface), BRCM and the dispensers. Despite my efforts, I could not locate any tripped breakers, GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter), or E-stop (Emergency Stop) circuits.=259606f4-5d2e-4a82-ab0f-3b1be71f65d3 =2906696a-9de0-4b84-9d2a-df31b6f44207 To further investigate the problem, I traced the wiring path from the FCI receptacle, leading me through three junction boxes before it extended underground outside the building. Subsequently, I returned indoors and meticulously traced the romex cables across the ceiling, ultimately leading me to a central pillar situated in the middle of the store.=b326496f-3c1c-4e4a-9bcf-5ad8cd5ff19b =fe56b65e-c0fa-4bf4-af30-2dd69ad93bfa Remarkably, halfway down this pillar, I discovered the presence of three light switches. Notably, the bottom two switches operated the canopy lights, while the top switch exerted control over all the fuel-related equipment, effectively serving as an E-stop light switch. Once I rectified this misconfiguration, normal functionality was promptly restored, and all the equipment came back online.=54704aae-f6ea-44ba-91dc-7d2e7b53444b =16d9b4dd-b298-48d9-8e4a-4d8940387c19 Furthermore, I took the opportunity to adjust the time in the tank monitor for the site, as it was observed to be off by 2 months. Additionally, I made the decision to unprogram the card readers, eliminating the requirement for post-sale confirmation on the register for each fuel transaction. I ensured to leave comprehensive instructions for re-enabling this feature, conveniently outlined under the C18.=e22ef7d8-cc37-4d9a-a4a6-76b2834bf758 =cf161197-2aa7-4ccd-9f93-48ea4767dd09 After conducting thorough tests, I am pleased to confirm that all functionalities were verified to be in proper working order, signifying the successful resolution of the issue at hand.
