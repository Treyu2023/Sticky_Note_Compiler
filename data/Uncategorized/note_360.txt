Nothing was bagged when I arrived the manager described what sounded like mechanical leak detectors tripping. He also stated that after some time they started working again. I monitored customers flow rates and saw no issues.=localId_20b25a225f0d481aacc3d89e39b11238 =localId_0b227199e90249809b4d0b3eae9354fd SS 132768=localId_8913b77dd4f24b4abc843895ee7487d7 10.5-11.5=localId_ed27a20ff7f442f080bd1a12111bb3f2 FWKD3232584=localId_af79bba17a3e4d5689b1b5f69937c62b 555 w mockingbird=localId_842e89912ef0489c8bece6bfe47313cf Dallas=localId_6a670b7690ce43d2af0509d79f58837d =localId_9633c00895cb4672ac91db26458680fc Already on site for prior Dispatch ticket. The hanging hardware was stolen from FP 3 & 4. I asked the site if they had any equipment before replacing with parts from my truck. I replaced 2 of each (hose,breakaway,swivel and nozzle w/guard) I purged air and checked for leaks before placing back in service. All test ok.=localId_3cfc49810a5c41dc82e0bbfb118983aa =localId_0934ddb39950471f8fe2e628969e90b9 11.5-12.25=localId_7b90e57d6be841d3b2ae82d70e35482c 12.25-17=localId_dccaab63cd18420c8e881f273c8caeec 17-17.5rttdh=localId_198a73b0f1f54163ae5e1c890a573d76 =localId_e194523532014605bb596231d15f7800 132811=localId_6833353690114084b47037c24b748ec3 191221055=localId_e68143a9347a40bd81884e2d9e7b415e =localId_ba1ed6c20326464f870d84b4d5f5ab34 Arrived on-site and checked in on SC and with MOD. FP14-16 were displaying pump offline. I investigated connections inside and at the dispenser. I then went to reboot the panther Box, but FP 1 had a stuck sale, due to activation issue on the UPM. I tried to activate, but the mounts on the UPM screw threaded inserts are broken I was able to temporarily repair the activation problem, but to truly fix it the CIM door will need to be replaced. After repairs and activation of FP 1 we cleared the sale on POS and then I rebooted the Panther fuel controller and this got dispenser 1 back up, but 14-16 remained offline.  There is a resistor missing from one of the sets of 2W in the panther on fp (15/16) also 13,14,15 and 16 are separated from the other channels by three spaces which suggests they are on a separate group so this resistor may be affecting both ports. We will need to return and get RT/NCR involved and check the configuration of the panther/tiger box.=localId_baad591711af49a4a945d7ff4488fc2c =localId_ad65df65bf2d4082952bba94960ac02c =localId_349aa7c8da9b4debae467160d62729ac 132973=localId_9ffac7e85afe460bafbe3612fd4f5da0 191220866=localId_7728a882e5384e71a86026e551318b94 =localId_911e4ef51185430285ec2c994930dd4f Already on site and corrected this issue while working on another ticket, but I am only able to repair the cim door mounts so much, the cim door will need to be replaced eventually to "fix" the problem.
