Prior to arriving at site I had to go by RT Distribution center and reinstall the high flow valve borrowed from stored Satellite. FP9/10 were flashing error code 20 (pulser disconnect) on the regular and mid PPU's. Site has installed security nut devices on dispensers. The manager stated that the error code came before security device installation. (FYI the device is easily bypassed with just a pair of Chanel locks) I cleared the EC and tested the affected products operation before placing it back in service. All test ok. =localId_6b418515a3a44437bc713a5c173b3b9f =localId_b7079ed6c7814ed68e99cb485d34c28c SS 11.75-12.25=localId_ebd065e348984299b8c3a02974e53e79 135889=localId_a5a794dedef342a8ab1ace933e8dd53d 200844468=localId_ffb8bee2342749598d0e28d1d68230c0 RT=localId_59f7a18eda9f4cd28ab549eebf5f17ff 4010 S Belt Line Rd=localId_57acf20699a9492ebb707fdbd1708b79 Grand Prarie=localId_f0113aaf411b4685bf93e2ef8b1889af =localId_c1d59e152e8f4194aafa682a7cc180e5 Already on-site, L:2(Diesel STP) & L:3(Premium STP) sump sensors are in alarm. I inspected both to find they have taken on water, roughly 200 gallons in total. I did not detect gas or diesel in either containment. Will need pump truck for removal.

System halted in BIOS. I replaced the UPM, programmed, RKL'd, downloaded TLS certs, uploaded personalities and purged CRIND to take a download. The CR's wouldn't work on either side of 5/6. They kept stating dispenser unavailable. HD said they were offline like in a breached state pertaining to door security. I tried multiple times to reset the security and called HD back before I found the 2W cable had became unplugged by accident. Once connected I got HD to update EMV files on CRIND then I was able to test EMV Debit transaction.

T:2 (E85) had 5 errors on the ATG including Probe out. I investigated probe to find the lid has pinched the cable in two. I cut the bad spot out and used an epoxy pack to remake the cable. All test ok.
