Initially, the ticket suggested the hanging hardware had been replaced, which delayed my inspection of these components.=d09dcbec-8135-41e5-95c7-822b1f7659fc =0ba82e45-2db3-4a0b-98ae-df6c7db483fc Diagnosis:=43b9f417-7fb1-4289-8843-2b9d74a99a56 Hardware Issues: Upon closer inspection, after unresolved troubleshooting, I discovered that both the nozzle and breakaway on FP 10, and the breakaway on FP 9, were preventing fuel flow.=3a4023e1-6612-443e-b640-8da115756587 Assessment: The breakaways in use, Catlow brand with a manufacturing date of August 2012, appeared aged and potentially reused. This raised concerns about their integrity, as materials like these can suffer from dry rot if exposed to fuel and then allowed to dry.=243fd920-428e-4001-b2c9-3e81f83e007a Actions Taken:=ecdb52a1-8333-4f86-9c44-bf34d712a8c1 Replacement: The site lacked spare breakaways, so I supplied and installed two from my van to ensure continuity of service. Additionally I installed a nozzle  from my van as well.=8c1128ef-3380-4705-99aa-6de2951b9347 Education: I advised the site personnel about the shelf life and proper handling of such hardware to prevent future issues. Photographs were taken to document the condition of the old hardware.=dbb902b9-4a68-4062-bdde-2d922ac0fa22 Conclusion:=c99a4d2b-1972-4e87-9bd6-32b26f99b280 The installation of new breakaways rectified the flow issues, restoring full functionality to the dispensers. I monitored the operation briefly to confirm no further problems arose. The importance of using fresh, undamaged hardware was communicated to prevent similar issues. All systems tested OK, and the site is now operational with the newly installed hardware.=07c49c02-4493-4129-9c95-8c64a4f627f4 =92b3ffaa-22d1-4ddd-a1c2-7e68605bed04 13.5-14 15 miles=ea3c49b1-b1ca-4ae8-8d9d-b25f464d03f3 14-16.5=752faaae-f76a-497b-a18d-a4f02e4d38e5 16.5-18 71 miles=f51a2991-2a27-41e0-8d7b-5b0d68435338 240508-0320=ec4877e3-1d40-4c73-9da7-92318bd7682a PO - 12368274=e7e31f3d-05a3-4a4a-9ce5-1d0f2e38adf4 Sheetz #472=b885ee8c-df4d-4bcc-b75a-35e0971570cf 10206 S Main St=c0750c9b-af40-44e7-8d43-2de46e58f59c High Point NC, 27263=1a1f5c4a-8ec6-49ee-8849-d1fe689fde68 =a94beb18-aa9c-4c14-840c-6c57f73401e2 Arrived on-site and checked in with the manager, Mike. Together, we located the keys to access the dispensers. I set dispenser 5/6 to standalone mode to conduct detailed diagnostics and pulled the dispenser logs for review. The logs confirmed the recurring errors reported, with the first occurrence traced back to January of this year.=6cab4e64-1bf9-4f46-8c23-38f00f100224 =373ea088-8c9a-469e-84fa-2f0f48e8a3c8 Diagnosis:=1d007c06-834d-4d96-a4fa-229436077067 Flow Rate Issue: Initial tests of 0 and 100 blend ratios revealed slow dispensing at a rate of 6 GPM. Further investigation showed incorrect filter installationâ€”the filter used was suitable for up to E25 but was inappropriately installed on the E85 grade.=d79149ea-1c1b-4a7d-9f57-92e4dd98910f Component Check: After replacing the filter with the correct model, there was an improvement in flow rate, though not sufficient to resolve the error 4312 codes entirely.=8ab748ac-196e-49f7-b22d-bf48a2df26aa Actions Taken:=6fa51c32-55f1-43c5-b389-1a0baa8dd11a Consultation with TAC: Discussed the potential damage to internal components caused by the incorrect filter, as indicated by the warning on the sticker above the filter housing. TAC suggested that the meters and the proportional valve are likely damaged and could not conclusively rule out impact on the steering valve components.=b33886a4-edea-4809-8543-b4309c934352 Ordering Parts: Based on TAC's advice, I ordered two E85 meters and two E85 proportional valves to replace the possibly damaged components.=9e2a7515-c5a4-41b8-bb68-2f719d9d8ebe Conclusion:=02b53558-2d05-4492-a635-0d3b7726f387 I will return to the site with the necessary parts to replace the potentially damaged components and conduct further testing to ensure full functionality and optimal flow rates are restored. The intervention aims to rectify the issues permanently and prevent similar occurrences in the future by ensuring correct filter usage and regular maintenance checks.=dae93225-637f-4d58-a17b-e4cdb21163da =5bc1fdce-103d-4515-ac9b-70a8d5cf26e6
