We replaced the STP-SCI controller for the REG master position. Calibrated the controller and monitored site operations for a short time.

I checked the ATG and found no history of power loss since record keeping began on 11/20/22. Additionally if the ATG was losing power this site is using PLLD leak detection and a reboot would suspend fueling while the ATG was offline. I tested and swapped the cable to the patch panel since a spare was available, both tested good. I ran a couple of trace routes from the ATG to verify outside connectivity. The intermittent communication loss is not likely from the ATG. I would point towards the server rack connections/powered devices that may be causing the connection to drop out.
