Reviewed the four previous tickets from our competitor who had been attempting to resolve the site's INCR Rate warning issue on the Veeder Root. The rate is currently showing a leak of +1.5 GPH. Discovered the siphon manifold is concealed under a concrete slab near dispenser 2.=c18ea61c-6f3a-40a1-9095-a868634da13f =a5cc3bda-692f-4eb1-a9d5-452bbe887905 We suspected this is the high spot where the copper tube is running. Took pictures and forwarded the information to the team lead for further review. Discussed possible causes with Mohamed and replaced one copper tube connector on the Siphon check valve, which Mohamed supplied.=0aa47a49-28e4-4c80-abab-2ee1ff692005 =081251fd-2105-47ce-a3eb-10f96b6c3807 A preliminary test using clear hose adapted to the copper line showed continuous bubbling, indicating a significant leak either in the tubing or the siphon bar itself. Next steps will include generating an estimate for concrete removal to accurately diagnose and resolve the issue. All work is complete for now, pending further action.
