I addressed the FCI box cable by leveraging an alternative wire configuration and replaced both ends to match.  I adjusted the polarity of the Kerosene wiring, and set its dispenser programming to match the POS. A new power supply was installed in dispenser 1/2, and I reloaded the Commander and configured for HPS network compatibility. The Applause mini server's software was updated and synced online. I updated all OMNIA/SSoM Devices via the BRCM tool. Although I made efforts to register the Commander,  but VSID provided was from old site without ASM agreement, no other VSID associated with this address. I attempted to register the dispensers with insite360, but they lack access to the internet with the MNSP. I was able to execute successful EMV transactions both indoors and outdoors.
