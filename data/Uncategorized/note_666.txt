The replacement of the card reader on FP 5 and adjustments to the network setup should enhance system reliability. However, persistent 2W communication challenges with FP 1/2 and 9 highlight the need for further investigation into field wiring conditions or the consideration of wireless alternatives to stabilize the system fully. These measures have set a foundation for improved dispenser functionality, with a caveat for ongoing monitoring and potential future interventions to address any lingering connectivity issues.=19bc2647-e392-45a1-a5c1-9bbbdbf02efa =5a1883cb-b928-48ed-953d-10817e20420b =73afb312-e309-4661-9395-5e9163159178 =a9d92bc7-8686-4376-9e39-1ea50fb6510e =135e69d6-77cd-456c-aea4-15bf9809951f =7a655ca0-4d6d-43f8-872d-123db194d821 =d33b771c-bf8c-471f-9b35-b27ef0245184 =723ee59f-9512-4b48-a785-1975cda3343e =4c1b8229-26d9-4d9d-824b-b12250802a8e =9775f7cb-a279-426a-a66f-92d74be074f1 =2097e44a-cea0-449c-93c0-6770970ee8f4 =e6ff70df-9911-4b75-a87e-d966e19b00ec =c1ad87de-c6cf-409c-a309-9faaf1fb2cba =2818b6f3-fba0-4615-b8dc-31739014d425 =4ea221b9-0e4e-4ca3-8462-440582e3f39a =91bc3b33-718c-49dc-9f19-aa1fd9ba529d =b5dba52c-7b4f-462f-b10b-76ae407d4e97 =7321bf7f-085f-47b5-8714-83d550619a7d
