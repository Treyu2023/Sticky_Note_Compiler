Performed scheduled upgrade of POS equipment to latest version of Buypass Exxon Verifone software 3.12.30. Worked to reload the second register which was not operational on arrival. The ethernet port was very flaky on Register 2, so we got approval to replace it with a rebuilt unit. I performed the replacement and completed the software upgrade of system. Once complete I tested card transactions inside and out. I opened the store and forecourt for business, shortly afterwards the cashier brought to my attention that sales for fuel were coming back inside like the CRINDs were offline, no poll errors were showing on the POS screen. On checking the CRIND screens outside FP 4-12 were cycling "please pay inside" & "Loading secure prompts" I initialized DCRs from the Register before purging 4-12 at the CRINDs. I then had to reboot the Commander before they would load. Afterwards I was able to watch customers use cards inside and out and dispense fuel without issues. All test ok.

He explained what sounded like losing prime on FP 1/2. I adjusted the programming to set STP pre start to run all pumps and increased the lamp test time to 7 seconds. I believe the issue was air being pulled in from the other grade pumping unit while in operation. After changes multiple people dispensed without issue. The Non Ethenol flow rate is low. I pulled out the filter and strainer(filter manifold strainer) and they seemed clean. I adjusted the bypass valve tension screw but nothing really increased the throughput of this dispenser. Customer stated that it is ok because it is used mostly for gas cans. All test ok.
