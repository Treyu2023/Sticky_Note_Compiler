The customer had their travel center counter remodeled and since then the network is showing offline. I traced cables to other register which is online and tested the cable. The cable is good. I then contacted Ventus who stated their box is online for 7 hrs but can not ping the payment processor. I could not gain access to the sites office or locate the EPS device on site. The register is only performing one day close every 3 months. The truck stop POS is performing a day close every day. I performed a day close but this did not correct the issue. I found out the site has new owners and therefore they arent a customer in our system at this time. I forwarded this information to service manager as well as contact info. Will return to troubleshoot once we can get to the equipment.=f93f7e8a-f5b9-4288-a8ae-c5414860ede5 =2915d377-bfe5-4af8-bc5f-48a4c74345c1 =aab054d3-cf00-483b-8fdf-c263ff503468 Cybera MAC address=24afbe76-c8c5-4991-9126-42a38ef20181 Travel Center - BC:B8:52:04:30:10
