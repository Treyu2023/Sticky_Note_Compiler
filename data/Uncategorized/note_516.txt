I went over pump amd CRIND settings. I changed com type to IP, I set mutual authentication for TLS mode. I contacted GVR and downloaded TLS certs. Afterwards the CRIND took a download. I rebooted the Passport and EDH. I cleared buffer on FP 11 to remove old transaction. FP6 the manager stated that it always said wrong PIN on debit transactions.  I found RKL set to 7111 I changed this to SHL3.

I changed the overfill settings for DEF, B20 [1+2] and B100 Tanks. I reviewed the notes/templates provided by the electricians on install. (No mention of overfill) The B100 overfill is wired to the Junge. I made sure only B100 was configured for this relay and all tanks are using B1:S7 relay for overfill. If different configuration is desired we will need more information on which Relay/wires to use.

The report printer was unplugged, I corrected this. The passport was hanging on network section of shift close. I rebooted and ran another shift close.after this made no difference I contacted TAC & they had me run the event viewer and them move the file trees associated with the errored application to the approved launcher folder to allow permissions. Afterwards we ram another shift close without issues.
