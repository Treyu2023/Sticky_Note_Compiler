I scaled the AST and removed the probe to conduct testing in the same locaion as reporting. I used the water finding paste to determine there is no water present. Through touch sensing with the probe stick I can detect an unknown contaminant in the bottom of the tank. I tried sweeping the bottom of the tank where the probe was installed, but the contaminant needs to be cleaned or the accuracy of the water detection float is comprimised. I spoke with Admin team and they are sending equipment by to pull a sample from the bottom of the tank.=8ef6dcea-2d79-474e-b81a-33d0c7659306 =0d118283-b2d9-494b-b600-6e88a21f69df T11-11.75 15 miles=0c06db82-e93a-4e30-8227-45959f1d7813 11.75-12.25=f35daaa2-340a-4e35-9c03-0a570c78cb40 221116-0074=a1f1acae-f425-4c40-81ae-f1ab877de0b0 1-5434968682=f5cab515-c689-4aff-9178-54b395b58849 GVRID 865167=9e2b2efe-6876-4cac-b56d-16e49499ef12 711 #41126=554620f0-6507-4ab2-a352-88acc0d1cf1a 1440 greensboro Rd=999d9548-436d-44ee-882f-750e3b99ba08 High Point=97b8404d-9913-4c07-99d7-5e27cf96d7de =d71662dd-1857-4d45-a6df-a5e2b3bd99c9 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.

Dispenser 5/6 is the only dispenser that does not have a UX410(Contactless module) installed. The programming on 5 was correct, but 6 was programmed for VFI contactless module. This causes the receiver to be active and without anything connected to it it will pick up tiny fluctuations for the electronics within the dispenser tricking it into thinking there is a contactless transaction taking place during and conflicting with any card inserted. I changed the programming and tested the dispenser.
