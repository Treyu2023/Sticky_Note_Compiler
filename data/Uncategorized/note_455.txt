I diagnosed the connection of the ATG and found that the VPN of the Cybera keeps going offline. I contacted Cybera and we ran several checks and could not get the Cybera to switch to the backup internet. after several attempts and rebooting all of the network equipment. Cybera is shipping a new unit to the site. The issue with the remote polling of ATG will likely also be corrected once the cybera has a stable VPN connection. I explained everything to Majors and to Omar the manager as well as the site owner. Everyone is on the same page with whats going on and needs to happen. All work complete at this time.=f381d5f4-435b-4e47-91de-9ca4e9df4703 =5e273af9-8073-4fd9-9130-66f2a12adce3 =cbd16a03-af84-4814-b3fd-d46244705b92 =beaa604b-0b97-45e2-aa80-2aab9bc84a4f =9e02aeca-46d7-445d-b1b9-a08f032a226a =34be9780-1836-4c37-99ac-62c06b1c2aa8 =680b10da-ce8b-4eb9-bdfe-26b4fe1055dc =ef099d77-542c-449e-a490-f127469689da
