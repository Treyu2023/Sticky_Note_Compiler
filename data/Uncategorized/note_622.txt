I reviewed the site history but couldn't find anything on FP 4. I checked in with the attendant who contacted the manger who stated that it was saying "no card pay now" outside on the card reader this morning. I ran the BRCM update tool which did update one device and the filter rule. I then ran the 2w diagnostics which reported no issues (All Green) I then asked that they reboot the EDH from time to time. Its likely something with the EDH causing the issue. =c1bcc936-c2bd-4965-8fab-610b5b694d1b =4e77f44b-9ae2-47aa-a5c1-ae58ff1a850b
