I checked in on SC and with MOD.  #3 diesel pulser was removed, #1 door has been breached. #3 power connector neutral came loose and had to be immediately repaired. #9,18,19 and 20 all showed signs of forced entry to the electronics cabinet. #19 pulser was removed and re-installed, I had to remount to get the missing screw out.
