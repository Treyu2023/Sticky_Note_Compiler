I could get the sales to clear even if I put the dispenser in standalone and ran a sale then forced that sale inside it was still in the same state. I spoke with the manager who had already spoke with NOC and done basic troubleshooting. I explained to him what I could try and spoke with NOC myself. They stated that they were working on a way to clear the issue without rebooting the site controller. Unfortunately at this time I dont have anything outside of rebooting the Fuel controller to remediate the issue. =30133a2f-f8f5-4c34-a9d5-e2ecfe1a2276 =f34e257d-fdfb-49b7-86ea-6aae42c0f1f5 =6a2f4123-5b60-41f1-9a23-64b896a45d27Loves 299=f29753f8-f6d7-4391-9d5c-06cf8b06f77b1701 US HWY 75=847004c3-5956-4a93-b01b-f848c010d801 =fd330763-eded-4b6b-a7ef-e7e7d71bafd8 =e348c586-0a0c-4b6c-a46b-270e010f68a0VMS - 129422=908b3199-fe3c-4ab2-b22d-5522f6ffa2d9POSC - 177434670=bc9ef0c4-99b6-4801-9a8a-bdccd7a6130c =b21f71d9-9c8c-4abb-aacb-474b1a1799501145AM - 1215PM RTT=dbe4abb5-58db-4df1-9f72-b632a151630b1215 -130 PM RTL=72800e78-fcce-4b0f-abf9-2752e7caee5c=b38ea6f7-089f-4cb2-8df2-2dc58559e5da Arrived onsite and spoke to the Manager about the issue. I gathered a nozzle and the keys from him and made repairs to the Hanging hardware on FP 6. I did not have to use the sites parts so I returned them to the manager. The pipe dope they were using is just very dry and old. I advised him on how to remedy this. I also cleared a paper jam on the printer for FP 6. Returned the sites keys completed both of our paperwork and closed ticket on SC.
