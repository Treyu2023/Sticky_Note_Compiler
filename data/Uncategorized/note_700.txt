The site was confirmed to be running Buypass version 3.12.48, consistent with Exxon protocols, and all software versions aligned with the specifications outlined in Base 53.40 release notes, specifically Engage Software version 2.03.03.702 for the PIN Pad.=37342730-66c7-479a-9ab0-56c1aed997c8 =c9f60026-8500-4b9b-8553-c37bfdf1a221 Diagnostic and Actions Taken:=d6b2d236-a606-4555-84d2-755ef99d3894 =17fea7fa-a579-4e0a-b525-f57b83aaed7c PIN Pad Diagnostics: I performed diagnostics on the PIN Pad at register 2. Testing with a smart card was initially successful, but any slight movement of the card while inserted caused rapid fluctuations in connectivity, leading to potential transaction processing errors.=bd92bd39-8e1a-4600-b32e-cd2b52bab35a Replacement of PIN Pad: Given the unstable connection observed during testing, I decided to replace the PIN Pad. I retrieved a replacement unit from our branch and expedited the ordering of the Debit Key to streamline the installation process.=794dc9ca-9ac7-407c-9a02-f3611c096253 Installation and Testing: After installing the new PIN Pad and required software packages, I conducted comprehensive tests including EMV debit, credit, and contactless transactions to ensure full functionality.=9e0275a2-ab3b-4aec-9a91-17d527c03a68 Conclusion:=09538eac-f32d-478c-a774-4d0a6a229b56 The replacement of the PIN Pad effectively resolved the issues with card connectivity and transaction processing at register 2. Comprehensive testing confirmed that all payment methods were functioning correctly, ensuring reliable service moving forward. All systems tested were operational and met the required standards.=3a97e7ac-b557-4493-8203-35f20388fa63 =9cb8a77b-6fd8-4b20-9d0a-6cfc02a952d8 =e52e6c7c-33c7-4090-a87e-1b3bdaef5de1 =cfc825d7-7b9d-4b96-9aad-e60dafbcf6a7 =2fa292a2-f161-41ba-94a5-761b2aaf7345 =36a3f81e-7eca-45f5-8dc7-5def2c8e98e5 =94a26fed-14e3-45e9-ae8a-4ff42fb66234 =2664c627-0753-4adc-bb0d-a4a32b2505f2 2.04.02 r01 - KERNEL 7.0.2r	4.07.10 - 5300w XPI - VELOCITY L2 KERNEL 7.020l=5ea84b55-068c-424b-8206-40ce0a403113 =3f5a16d0-ffab-4d6a-b3fe-7ffd835b82c9 =9f01bf56-9db4-44da-9baf-a7dc475b270d =b5bd9321-c016-4014-9c66-bc25972b4816 =96134f9c-4f18-4371-8352-19a8ab952277 =77a3c290-5741-480d-81d6-dffb823fc2ca =c530c5f3-a8fd-4788-90e0-8ddbcb502e31 =bf7ce3ea-62be-4dcf-b5a8-c4593ea1e309 =b2c1e2ea-9049-4c7c-ae34-c24a9d28693b =fcee02e5-5c38-459e-a633-b681c2e7bbb0 =967f3109-43e2-4235-842b-6c4eb998f589 =30c84a2a-37ea-4622-94c1-65189d5ce845 =cc7400ee-0771-419e-9c50-f74800f6a702 =a9bb83a2-b7a6-4a81-af0d-2b5b13b43847
