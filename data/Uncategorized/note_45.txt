Checked card operations and loaded paper in receipt printers. FP22 satellite will not dispense. I contacted TAC and troubleshot for hours but was unable to resolve the issue. Will need to return on SR during normal hours to make repairs.=localId_719708dc75e344fbabcec2d3899dae5a =localId_244e0258c6384d58905743780ecc242f 20-20.5=localId_17a6e38cbb83482c8147ee23bfbcd814 20.5-=localId_d5b04f1140c44b71a4463f656a9a1247 TBD=localId_732dc709b44d4044acd6182606d793fc 199858835=localId_ce32678f52184845b6bbe423a7fa7f17 RT=localId_3523679c876b42c8b6449cc476bfe5bd 2834 W University DR=localId_e43d520b3cb24661aee5e592f4cd0ff7 Denton=localId_9691f6a364d64166bee70324d2241898 =localId_4c448b653c3e441582a3071ad5198cf3 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  I checked the E-Stops outside, both are momentary switches. All the MAG VFCs and ATG were operational without alarms. The site manager explained that they keep losing power to just the Verifone Pin Pad when the issue occurs. I think we need to pull up the floor and have an electrician here when we do. This site has self checkout terminals added. The E-Stop located at the register runs through the floor right through this area.There is a good chance the issue is right under this high traffic area. Incompleting ticket.
