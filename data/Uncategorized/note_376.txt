I restored power to 13/14 the breakers are not accuratelyb labeled.  The breakaway on FP#1 was not repairable, so I replaced it.  I tested card on FP#8 and placed in service.  I replaced the gas hose on FP#10.  #11 needs a diesel E-85 hose (this issue was not on any of the tickets for today).   Tested all parts replaced for leaks.  All test ok.=460dc736-b4e3-47f6-a50d-e1646ec7b7f3 =74b539ff-ddce-4d16-8eee-705b9bf1b34e VMS#132289=9e479426-f80d-4bc7-a3ab-762f5340a696 3:10- 4:10 PM  RTT=691fc3e4-482d-4bed-b993-4a0714bc4b38 711=d6656524-8b4d-48b5-ad2b-8d4ce5622694 2120 Greenville Ave=eec6d89f-71fb-40e2-b2a8-81d3606464e0 Dallas=1a5481fb-09cb-43b3-9cc4-0522b22e7b5e Pump#1  SN:  EN200598=cfeb9a4c-d6f1-457b-bc71-5c19ec402b05 =6d34393a-d0d6-4339-856d-02d176d74658 Arrived on site, checked in on SN and with  MOD.  FP#1 has CR05 on the display (dismount).  I removed and reinstalled the card reader.  I checked the mounts and sensors.  It looks like the gasoline may have been absorbed by the gasket (minor swelling/deformation).  I was able to re-activate and test the card reader.

Site was unable to print shift reports.  They stated they couldn't close the shift yesterday for unknown reasons.  When I tried to print I found the configuration had defaulted. I spoke with manager, he couldn't tell me which categories to selected for shift report.  I selected some basic categories and performed a print out.  The cashiers told me this looks accurate.  They throw them away after printing and store no copies.  I tried to contact 1-800-987-0711 to confirm but was unable.  The site does not  wish to perform a shift close at this time.  This data interfaces with back office automatically.
