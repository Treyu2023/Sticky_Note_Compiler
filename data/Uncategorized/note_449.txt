Lynn Fueling had sent a few different technicians out here. They got the RUBYCI going. They bypassed the BRCM in the back room with the two wire and had no power on the BRCM. I powered up the BRCM and rewired all fueling positions to go through it again. I was able to get all the CRINDs online and tested a EMV transaction on one. By the time i took the signs off I went into the back room and the BRCM had no power. I troubleshot this to the EMI Filter on the BRCM was not passing power through it. I swapped the homeplug and the CRINDs came online again. I gave this a minute to make sure there isnt some other power issue. I then contacted dispatch to inquire about billingfor this customer and item.                                                                                                =64e4e4a9-418f-43c0-a56b-e8df5661b189 The BRCM was new and covered under warranty but the hour of labor for rewiring the site is not covered.=b9171cd3-6e85-402a-839f-80466777bdb4 =67e96377-5f02-4962-9a52-9049f3a12ed4 Serials=4ff07fb0-935c-4d1b-a01c-35e6a28de713 IN - KJJ0039845=a875af24-ee9d-4d25-9801-26f9dfa81d2c OUT - KJJ0041253=7667bbe1-ec21-4d96-97da-39a0428d3408 GVRID - 214238=91eccdd0-0339-40d3-ac66-285b5e690a91 =93faa195-e8cf-42ce-bea7-7832d0b32178 =2260a311-2cb4-42e3-b0db-6aba03c21075 11.5 - 12.5 RTT=a51ad6a1-a3a7-4fcf-901f-7ef97fc36c21 12.5 - 13.5 RTL=0346bd15-7e44-42e5-b03f-409e7b067f88 =3e3383c9-4e90-46bf-b11f-b1d7e7461a50 VMS - 130554=aa1123f5-e374-464c-a966-683b5101241a PO - 181526396=eff22e0f-0fdb-403e-94f9-d6d779975901 =8b966c61-8823-4f83-9b1a-d20048575d4d 7940 Lebanon Rd=a1e9041f-ece9-4270-af6e-6db9c8b44732 Frisco=615c81f5-9f63-4bc4-8365-3794ef60087f =08500221-1f9c-492d-a705-12251b4f01ec Arrived on-site and checked in with SC and MOD.

Investigated issue to find the motor would run then it would go into LU and/or OC. the relay in the MAG VFC would click in and out 3 or 4 times each time I ran a test making getting amp draws dificult. I replaced the MAG VFC after the manager had me wait for the Pepsi vendor to check in his inventory due to limited space in the Stock area.  Afterwards it was still having an issue with OC alarms preventing a test so I replaced the VS4 variable speed motor. This allowed me to test the line without issues.
