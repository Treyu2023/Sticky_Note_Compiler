The manager promptly brought to my attention several issues concerning the outdoor loyalty system and a specific problem with the cash button on the register.=dd4e574c-f272-4d52-9806-88d5b516b3a8 =562aa9be-3916-4a3b-ae80-e2e6d027c981 Loyalty Program Configuration:=a724b46f-996b-4acc-8626-2f536850b88c =55826fe0-0709-4f55-bb06-c69ad928f507 Marlboro Rewards Program: I initiated configuration for the Marlboro rewards program. It's essential to note that this is formally known as the Patron Rewards Program. The title "Marlboro" was locally adopted for clearer customer understanding during their selections.=cf4c186a-446e-491b-84c2-ae43b646fe2b Citgo Loyalty: While setting up the Marlboro program, the manager informed me about the malfunctioning Citgo Loyalty. I thus incorporated its troubleshooting into the day's objectives.=232d8fe0-46ee-4570-a452-cecd2a019c83 Post-Guide Actions: Following the provided guide for both programs, the concluding step for Citgo rewards necessitated a loyalty card table download and executing an end-of-day procedure to activate the table. After these actions, Citgo Club rewards operated smoothly across all sales, fuel included. The Patron rewards system, however, faced an issue where the selection and ID input phase was followed by a prolonged processing time, eventually returning to the selection page without any error message or feedback.=d0aef58f-b857-434d-81c0-5ef4145527cd Issue Identification & Solution Proposals:=be697eca-25f0-4dbe-b4ed-0a6d671a1e45 =ee1bd30a-e41a-4b89-b342-ba2a4455289c Card Table Size & Processing Time: A call to the Patron rewards helpdesk provided clarity. The representative pointed out a known issue with Citgo's loyalty card table being extensive. Given the vast list and limited processing time per transaction, the system frequently times out before completing its scan through the card table.=4f5ae8e0-9cd9-4f01-baf2-35e535a59638 Potential Solutions & Challenges: The recommended solution entails reducing the card table's size, retaining only the actively used ones. Considering the site operates on a RUBYCI, there's a constraint: the system only allows the deletion of one card at a time. Additionally, due to the enormous card list, the system resources are strained, causing noticeable sluggishness during client configuration.=4d8d3ea3-e855-4be7-9a61-1faa54eb6e12 Stakeholder Discussions & Decisions: I held discussions with Citgo, Verifone, and Chris. A consensus emerged, suggesting that system reload would be a more efficient solution compared to the tedious task of individual card deletions.=fc44f677-627e-425f-81cc-4df993d92302 Immediate Actions & Future Plans:=f4377c8a-e18b-43d1-9d02-db3aaa997b38 To ensure system stability, I've temporarily suspended all loyalty functionalities at the site. The plan moving forward is to return on Monday and execute a comprehensive reload on the system.=dfdaf24b-62a1-4cc9-8561-25270e1a673d =1efc8eda-3edb-47d2-a7b6-b93385a2b2fa =d34178a9-bd8b-4539-bda2-ca18d8769c6a =8f9124cf-b634-4209-bebe-3bf88e7af791 =041d817c-a08b-4410-8081-4926d44e534d =0b6b6739-83ce-45f3-b0ee-0654e058ae5a =e3672603-6f74-47dc-bbd9-1ff8205166a2 =b8c8d386-ba19-41f0-85dd-974d9c321e59 7504P84=700c4a2d-ae59-411f-bef4-bc3b3f9f728c
