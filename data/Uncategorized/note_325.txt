I upgraded the Commander and two Ruby2 registers to Exxon 3.12.42, the latest release on the portal. Followed Verifone's documentation for EM+Rewards program, and double-checked with the version that Mike emailed to the site to make sure the most recent routes were implemented. Additionally, I repaired a leaking hose connection on FP#3. All tests are satisfactory.=e75aae5e-4ac1-4956-b646-c4fb48cc3946 =579fafda-0050-4dfd-bc32-3feb0c37efdbCOD INFO=daed1987-93bf-41ad-93ee-ce92d48d86c9Labor             403.75=c85580ba-ce45-479a-87fc-e0e066b75f40Mileage         58.50   =bed23742-bedc-4055-a1a5-c26c8542f306Fuel Charge  12.50        =dbe328cf-ac72-42a1-a3bb-1a84d9d80829Tax                32.04  =efe8b227-7fa1-4eab-b3e6-b2912e2109aeTotal              506.79    =f2af1e8d-3161-4d5a-aa12-4db8a582ab9e =0db23fd3-4de3-4469-b2fe-7a0ddfc0f269 14.5-16.5 SHop/reroute from call to home/travel home=dccee8c4-e848-45a1-9453-a0999525b666 =2662f938-62a1-4f24-8c3e-cbeb89ecfe4b 18.5-19.75 50 miles=96144695-4017-484f-b7e1-227fa2768b68 19.75-23=1e859088-22b7-41aa-bf90-34b94529f735 230823-0390=b08778f7-c90d-4e48-a01c-9f2ee6392380 Speedway 7929=30a2868b-dcb6-4875-89ff-522dc9549f63 3110 Sandy Ridge Rd=163d7e19-8141-40d4-a982-d403ad3396c2 Colfax NC, 27235=94dd61ba-c523-4374-b724-7ec7ec5b5487 =aa8a787f-b0f7-465e-bc6b-cff44cfe879a Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.  I investigated the issue to find no one knows the dispenser level one security code so I had to start by cold starting and reprogramming the dispenser. I coordinated with the manager and set the password to the store number 7929. Once i gained access i found that only the premium on 11 and 12 is not working. I traced out the wiring to the steering valves and proportional valves and checked voltages. Everything was correct according to the manual. Due to some of the error codes and there being the wrong type of filter installed I replaced the premium filter. Then I turned the premium on at dispenser 9 and 11 and 12 would now dispense. On further troubleshooting I narrowed the issue down to the stp hook signal leaving dispenser 11 and 12 was only showing 26 VAC for premium where the regular shows 120. Ordering a T17461-g2 (valve driver board) for dispenser 11&12 9 and 10 was working when I arrived. It's worth noting that if the premium was not working and then someone drained the line pressure that could make following transactions on this dispenser throw error codes on the regular due to pressure differential backflow. So it is entirely possible that after each time the premium or (blended) mid grade was used the following transaction on regular would throw a code. With advantage dispensers I am unable to retrieve past codes they're gone once the handle is hung up. Will return with parts. =c41b6c10-c2a4-482c-8898-0f80e545a4f5 =403facaa-db85-4ee6-a378-51126f8fb4cf Same Site (P2 Hose Pull)=0bf19995-063c-43d2-8de3-5bb251ee48f5 23-23.5 =42ca05fa-06d7-4909-bd55-12652dbe3826 23.5-0.25=32da2e69-c451-4608-b445-7c875e5ef71d =8435bbe0-375e-4b24-aaee-c04f84387528 230823-0392=67fa943c-49e9-4531-a1c4-7edbb3120726 Speedway 7929=19bb5f6b-712d-4c8e-a212-5620dd7fbaa6 3110 Sandy Ridge Rd=526eabfe-251f-43f8-91ab-493e9c42a8e6 Colfax NC, 27235=ff144ec5-f7ce-41b2-96a9-0405ea475594 =01a4a20f-3890-4898-997f-8db39fffdfe2 Already on-site I addressed the P2 hose pulled call on dispenser 14. I was not able to reconnect and had to replace the breakaway. I then tested for leaks.
