I contacted store support and had them register the new MAC address. This restored communications but I still had to contact GVR TAC to deregister the old OMNIA board on the Insite WEB portal. I then had to contact NOC and have them clear the old MAC address and register the new one before I could finally register the OMNIA on Insite360. Roughly 1 hour was spent dealing with network issues after replacing the board. SS stated that 13/14 were showing Pump Proxy error. TAC stated that this is typically a Configuration error within the OMNIA programming,. I checked the OMNIA and the only thing I saw that was off was Pump IDs on the Applause configuration Tab. =70c48ad6-4aa3-4348-bd2b-473524e37891 =201fde35-f6b2-43a1-aa9f-2f598df6af83 At this point I decided to open a separate ticket for billing purposes. =eccc5833-e5d1-4760-bcf5-5603fc93810c =8fe98c94-3f75-432c-a59f-ec61599fe3f1 2PM- =48772512-4cab-4ae4-b527-8b3e7b57e088 =3f1d40fd-abe8-442b-ae38-eae935d26d8a Reloaded software on FP 13/14 While I looked through manuals trying to find more information on the dispenser Proxy error Store support is seeing, AFter checking all settings in the OMNIA and the dispenser finally I reloaded software on the OMNIA. I also checked the UPM settings. I then contacted Store support again and this time I was subjected to an unuasually long wait time, but once I got them they confirmed there were no longer any issues displaying for FP 13/14 on the Insite360 WEB portal interface. All test ok.=ff7ecd03-47f9-4411-8b8a-ee9dde6f229a =15b8eac4-1589-4dcb-aa5b-69051b68aa4a =abf633a5-3d3a-4980-8fa0-1a33bd3c10b4 =be60e81e-e2d8-4002-8d84-f96f67da3a7d =13b6e839-0229-4800-a7fc-4c95266ebcb6 =ae0d807e-0cc3-45bc-888d-0e1ae9d8b3fe =158f13fc-8219-429b-840c-0fd3936c5997 =641ab344-e25b-46ea-93ae-d8df5400e414 =aace8dfb-0396-4b88-930a-bef816eaae29
