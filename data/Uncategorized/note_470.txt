I explained the scope of work to the manager and shut down the DIesel Hi-Flo forecourt. I followed the playbook to upgrade and re-image the Trendar register. Had some issues and Del Parker was able to assist me, eventually we wiped the register and started over at 9pm with a clean image and proceeded to finish the job. All test ok.=9b8d741e-92e3-4f0a-9230-4fbdefdbb40f =162a3aff-ad36-4c9d-a055-93c1a43aff98 =74e140bb-3a56-42ed-946f-7eaab0fa90be 13-18
