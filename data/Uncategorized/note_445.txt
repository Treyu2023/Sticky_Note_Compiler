I found the atg not cycling but just stuck on system warm start. I Reseatted the the Communication modules and power cycled the tank monitor to see if one of them is dragging the system down. After this did not make a change I then cold started the ATG and restored configuration fromt he archive. I reprogrammed the date and enabled the lines before placing site back in service. The battery on the ATG was replaced two weeks ago. If the problem persists We may need to replace the CPU bd in the ATG.

I tried to replicate the issue from the ATG and witnessed a few people dispense on the Premium. I was not able to reproduce the alarm conditions. I then used the jumper settings on the MAG VFC to disable the alarm for extended run and asked the site personnel to keep an eye out for a dispenser that looks like its still running after sale completion. All test ok.
