I worked to get the Dover box online while not disrupting the sites card processing. I got to a point that I needed to add a USB to RJ-45 adapter to the Dover box to get the commander connected to it. I had to leave the site and go to Best buy purchase one which was not close by. After I returned I installed the network adapter and could not get it to work for a bit before I realized it will only work in one of the USB 3.0 ports. The owner showed up around this time and I discussed these ISP changes with him and he had me talk to his contact with Spectrum, I shared my service managers information with him so we could coordinate being on site with them when these changes are happening. After I got everything online and contacted the Simmons people and verified connectivity I was getting ready to leave and the card processing stopped working. I contacted Mako and they had me create a USB flash drive and install it into the MAKO box to set the WAN port to DHCP. Initially this worked for a bit then failed again and I had to call them back and we ran the procedure a second time after troubleshooting the second time it seemed to work. I also found out that this site did have their sim card swapped from the SPRINT one that no longer works. So its possible that some of the times we thought it was working in fact it was not. I also tightened the filter on the Kerosene dispenser #9 (it is working now)All test ok.=a22c9391-4d35-47af-a07b-299339a3e57f =2106d659-8ae1-4b3c-bf6d-691fd94c425b =df5257f2-8abf-424e-8539-77d1c3873899 =f5bed9c8-64dd-4f40-9a7f-4b9780dac202 =6de59b2c-e1d4-40ba-9001-365fcd3e0f54 =c67e75aa-5248-43c5-92f4-6286e47ec39b =d5a24bd1-70d3-4538-8625-9c1592100e7a =2320540c-39dd-45cd-be05-0191a3e14aed =7a7a7cb4-fb0a-40ff-a334-18b00af2921e =ebd3e2ad-ddd1-40a7-9936-a68275278907
