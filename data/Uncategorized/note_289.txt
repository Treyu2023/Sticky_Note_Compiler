I confirmed valid polling errors on Fuel Pumps (FP) 1, 4, and 15. A reboot of the Commander rectified the issue on FP 15.=723af947-8b52-4709-9c6e-bd3dbc0a708e =af52e6fb-f336-4694-a07c-4541b8e3e174 Specific Resolutions for Each Pump Issue:=cc61c51f-2224-467a-9c6a-3f1f371234a9 =1ab36e89-e181-4691-b405-f7b6b064d97a FP 4: Reassigned an IP address to its Card Reader to restore functionality.=483ac66b-490d-4a76-852d-5563e3ea63d2 FP 1: The Card Reader In Dispenser (CRIND) screen was non-responsive, resembling a power outage. However, the PIP 3 displayed green indicators, which is not consistent with a typical UPM failure. A power cycle to FP#1 brought the UPM back online. Subsequent tests on both FP 1 and 4 were successful.=d6d53c87-3477-440e-ae58-ec2a7793cb71 FP 14: This DSL Ultra-Hi Encore Master dispenser presented symptoms of a stuck meter. By manually adjusting the pulser, I shifted it into a 'fast flow' mode, which corrected the issue for multiple tests.=97473ae5-ff7e-477d-9874-c46ea6415bc7 Discussion with the Manager and Preventative Measures:=04c6a617-f16c-4800-a0e1-8b1add001b28 In light of the site's history and observed issues, I engaged in a detailed discussion with the site's manager. Demonstrating the process I employed to rectify the dispenser issue, I advised them on how to replicate it if necessary. However, I emphasized that this is a temporary solution and not a definitive fix. Given the recurring problems, I recommended a two-fold approach:=f5837f27-614e-47de-8cbd-9f83cee2a1ca =0c014952-f247-4591-83c3-c8c0f2dd5bcf Introduce a filtration system before the meter to capture contaminants, ensuring cleaner fuel flow.=b83bcd0d-c4fe-4b7c-96b5-de035134d955 Consider a comprehensive cleaning of both tanks and fuel lines to address the root problem.=cbaf1a02-c8c2-4769-b742-06ceb89f5ae0 I gathered tank samples and photographed the hydraulic cabinet of the dispenser. These materials will be invaluable for generating a quotation on the installation of a pre-meter filtration system.=3f3e7435-d19d-4778-8a4a-89c070cea5e4 =dd0c0545-8b6c-4e20-995a-a2bbfe95c6f8 Conclusion:=26d556c9-b697-432a-966b-ecfb937e21d8 The site's persistent issues are indicative of underlying contamination problems, not just symptomatic hardware failures. Immediate intervention with filtration and cleaning is pivotal to provide a long-term solution. Future efforts should target the source of these complications rather than merely addressing their aftermath.

The site is experiencing issues with their loyalty and payment host configuration. Unfortunately Mahdu was not available and we could not get into the office. I tried to connect to the network via a switch from the register , however this process was hindered as the password has been changed and I can not reset the password without getting the OTP from the commander display in the afformentioned locked room. We are scheduling for a tech to come by tomorrow and contact Mahdu to gain access to the commander. =756205ec-b8e3-48e9-9bea-67864d7309da =2571d834-121a-4545-af26-944fb98e9955 =fcdf7286-39bb-438b-91e6-a96298c9c906 =c8b913a3-6d03-4a51-a197-cd7db2b3d186 =3d08a8b9-88cf-4159-b0b4-f14fa3438393 =f7fa3e7c-2245-4a11-a341-6abf4d171299 =b5aca8a2-3c7e-47c7-99a3-308f82eda2c9 =36412c00-9c00-45f5-9547-26ee622b93c5 =950d9f51-e94a-4765-82bf-687d2fea5761 =1cce4fc0-03bf-40f4-85ae-1489f1066740
