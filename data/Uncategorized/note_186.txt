I then started getting hits on all of the cables in the back room indicating that there is a network issue likely in the terminal stiprs where they Tie in and visible corrosion is present. The site needs to contact their internet/phone service provider and straighten out issues on their equipment. If the site is still having issues with the ATG afterwards then we should re-open this ticket. I believe the ATG and security camera systems will work as intended when the Networking issues are corrected.=2505090a-c856-4658-b2b8-14902476a6cb =f4083fda-8cec-4e43-9faf-7d1f90c1234f T11.25-12.25 45miles=065e87c4-5a38-434a-a4d9-23b5e89c4c8d 12.25-=ded572a4-a087-4e20-ae4c-1ca316deeb49 221123-0160=52df348a-27d4-4185-9ea4-4f488d3e4b96 PO - 226500178=92705741-8d5c-46cd-8941-2eccdebeb274 Tracking - ""=b823836f-765c-4efa-8681-07096d8212a0 Refuel=cced1557-2f09-43a2-a708-339ab69eeae6 403 Albemarle Rd=a1a182a7-3d46-4a8f-a395-7da2ea7cbf3e Troy=fb64a5bd-45ab-42cc-ad21-aad8122988ac =d5b3fdd6-3c4c-40ac-94cc-60409eb36926 Arrived on-site, checked in with IVR and MOD.=1a5bf05b-a504-4b5f-985e-c8a0d6bf1188 The voltage at the relay looked good for Reg2, the amperage was holding at 20Amps and tripping the thermal. I installed a capacitor and the amperage was still at 20. I called in for a second man and worked at getting the motor loose until Fernando showed up. Fernando and I pulled and swapped the motor. Afterwards the amps were holding at 3.5 and the site was operating normally. All test ok.=01db420e-574a-43b1-bc76-271e974b1a37 =31cab232-388e-4787-8b67-94ce2b636c5c =6229ec57-a208-4a7a-a4ec-eae0861f5f66 =9596cb68-335f-49ac-a150-e653bb335416 =b1b3695a-6429-408c-ae3e-dd915749446c =119fd810-2d95-49c8-8d83-28453e291b9b =d3e1f6c7-cbac-49e0-89ce-9a47e0cab0ea
