The manager apprised me of an issue with FP 11 whereby customers were unable to use their cards and the softkey keypad was not beeping upon key press. In order to investigate the matter, I conducted a thorough examination and discovered that the door cables had become entangled, which caused the disconnection of the softkey keypad and the beeper plug on the PIP 3. I successfully resolved the issue by carefully bending the pins back into place and ensuring that the cables were properly secured using the clamps on the door to prevent future occurrences. In addition, I located the volume jumpers for both FP 11 and 12, which were found to be dislodged and lying in the dispenser. I reinstalled them and conducted tests using an EMV Debit card, which confirmed that all keys were functioning properly and the beeper was operational upon key press. Following the successful completion of the tests, I returned the key to the attendant and confirmed that all was in good working order.=fce03d79-eca1-477f-a85a-d67dc99381dc =d31527b7-45f2-4a3b-bc55-c24bdb7807fc 12.75-13.75 55 miles=42b5c4c2-ff94-4dcd-a910-948fd296f106 13.75-14.75=7a98cb57-b10a-4bbf-94f7-e31216ed47dc 230308-0097=ae411889-c83b-496b-bc8c-ec6f4ce24aa3 PO - 0257152=5442d139-672e-470d-a17a-b6cc7fe7273a Speedway#7939=c21c4f90-36dd-461b-b5e9-4e84caae46fa 5916 W Market St=02355a0a-2332-4bac-bb26-4344eed1aeda Greensboro=b9efe27f-d960-4ddd-bbcd-51d5f9b70347 =4f87e8da-5828-4a64-8341-e84d2801e9ce Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and proceeded to install the power regulator board that was previously ordered into dispenser 5/6. Subsequently, I conducted a comprehensive test of the fueling operations to ensure that they were functioning as intended. Following the tests, I confirmed that all systems were in optimal condition and working as expected.=9bb9ab2f-1b92-46b4-b232-633c41f7c07e =a3448f2c-9aa2-43b0-8ff1-dc7819881c52 =200b2818-19e4-4d3a-b5d6-73041e7ec997 =685ee7ba-49ae-4d91-a67c-8b7db8d9f6c9 14.75-15.75 Commissioning ticket=5492d801-de68-4323-8a71-f839ff0946c5 =e697f78a-e502-4f46-a359-fb90f1698841 =d9a2090b-e171-4264-914b-f1b7e5704a06 =b153f5d3-5801-4be5-81e4-bb777cd6b8fd =4f965d45-ea7e-435d-a971-ff4580a844d3 =f65821c9-48f7-4913-bfff-e09e25ca930d =066890ad-9105-48ec-844f-d2ff1a449b69 =fc7150fe-1adf-4bcc-b3d3-07051e2c476f =06d3731c-11b7-4770-a971-583932bcd233 =8cb6ed4f-8930-4831-974f-a5feb8df999b =45bdcf13-aac5-4144-98e8-0c2d5110a092 =4989e07e-f06d-43fb-a00a-c3ffe01af426 =251e55f5-f304-4820-bc64-b9b646a602a0 =1f9d68c7-2ba6-4294-b284-8e353285657c
