FP 5/6. I put the dispenser in standalone and dispensed all products on both sides without issues. Not sure what it was doing before. FP 6 when rebooting for standalone the CRIND got stuck on BIOS screen stating only "Scanning" this did not clear after reboots and waiting 5 minutes. I relaced the UPM on FP 6. I updated the software and RKL'd the UPM. I programmed it and tested it on FP 6 with EMV Debit transaction at the CRIND.
