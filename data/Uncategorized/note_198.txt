On checking the diesel STP sump I discovered an active leak that looks like the ball valve itself is leaking. I shut the ball valve stopping flow of diesel to half of the dispensers as well as the leak. There's a few inches of diesel in the sump that will need to be extracted prior to repair work being performed on the line. I Contact dispatch to coordinate pump truck and heavy maintenance for repairs.

The manager explained that 12,14 &16 were offline earlier. FP 12 and 16 came back up on their own and 14 was not communicating to the card reader. I showed the Manager how to reboot the DEX should they experience sporadic com drops on various FP's. I rebooted the dispenser for FP 13&14. 13 came up normally where 12 took an unusually long time whole processing logs during boot. Eventually it came up communicating normally. The site may have experienced a power loss issue where not all of the equipment was able to sync properly. I monitored site until I saw customers use the affected FP's. All test ok.
