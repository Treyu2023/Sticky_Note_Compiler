At Fuel Pump (FP) 8, I verified that the card reader and CRIND payment system were functioning properly on the gasoline side. Following this, I disabled the flint lock on the diesel side to further investigate FP#17.=95fc70a4-3a78-4c0e-8bf5-fd4f0d042412 =f9151f12-b0e7-4dcc-851e-130731b5077d Upon testing FP#17, all electrical components appeared to be in good working condition. The hanging hardware is brand new and showed no signs of moisture. Voltage was also successfully reaching the valve on the slow-flow circuit. The diaphragm for the Skinner valve appeared to be intact. However, I couldn't assess the coil due to its wiring configuration. Swapping it with another position would necessitate shutting down more than half of the lanes currently open to the public. A coil needs to be ordered, and it might also be advisable to replace the valve diaphragm.=052bd6d3-c3a7-4a6a-8c41-8f51355b9455 =02f8d3fd-fe9c-4791-a5ed-f363230f29c6 At FP#20, the DEF nozzle breakaway/swivel combo is physically broken; any attempts at reconnection and testing resulted in a DEF spray and immediate disconnect. Additionally, FP#21 requires an old-style, non-secure card reader, which I didn't have in my service vehicle. All work completed for the day; additional parts will be needed for further repairs.=d67d7ee5-e6f6-4f12-85cc-522d15485aad =ec17d783-b6db-4dbd-8498-d2f7a03bb8da Seaparate ticket 230825-0047 stated that the Diesel lane 19 was not dispensing.
