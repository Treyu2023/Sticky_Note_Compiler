The Card reader on FP 4 was in error. I checked the software version and looked up the CR 03. This error stated that the CR was in tamper state and replacement is required. I replaced the CR and activated it. I then tested a card transaction.

Investigated issues with dispenser 9/10 to find there were no issues with the dispenser at this time. What the cashier described to me sounded like stuck sales, she even showed me stuck sales on another dispenser and stated that it was like that. The sales are since cleared. I tested card at dispenser 10 then put it in standalone and tested 9/10 diesel since those nozzles were the only ones bagged off. Both Diesels worked fine. I had to wait on the delivery driver to finish offloading before I could return test product to tank. I monitored 9/10 for a few customers after placing it back into service. I wnet to the BRCM and ran the update tool to ensure all devices have been updated. I found that hey have been updated. More importantly, I found that the site has milk crates stacked 6 high in the BRCM closet and this stack is up ahainst the BRCM Homeplug and ethernet cable. The manager did state that when this issue occured that the dispensers were all offline. It was only when she came to the BRCM to reset the Tiger box that she stated she must have bumped the ethernet cable because the dispensers came back online. I am all but certain this was the issue.
