We could not make that happen today and the contractors neeeded it to happen today, they had the tools and connectors needed themselves and together we re-routed the conduit for the Veeder root sensors going to the tank pad from outside run along the wall to inside through the drop ceiling coming out into the back of the existing box. The E-stop circuit on the corner of the building was moved about 4 feet towards the front door. This was done so the mason workers can reface the whole damaged side of the building. Once completed I verified the only alarm on the veeder root was the pre-existing communication alarm for D:8. All test ok.
