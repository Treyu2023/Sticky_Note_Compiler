She informed me that according to Verifone, the issue with the RUBY 2 system was due to full memory.=a3cd13ec-9561-4ff5-9d8c-59634367abe7 =c2bda39e-f237-41da-b744-f157cfb0b455 To address this, I initiated a reboot of the system into diagnostics mode and conducted a RAM test, which included a memory purge. Despite this intervention, the touchscreen remained unresponsive. Proceeding with a different approach, I reloaded the software on the RUBY2. This action resolved the issue, restoring normal operation to the touchscreen interface.=cc2dedd1-7143-4415-a841-9d41430d34ae =74ccd868-f2fc-4aa9-b01e-318794e44f6d Concluding the visit, all systems were tested to confirm functionality, with positive outcomes across the board.=677c8d7b-e335-409a-beaf-c0a0f2476d50 =0870090e-4c43-4dd4-9256-258a5664c389 Before leaving the site  cashier brought to my attention an issue they were having with the PIN Pad on the other register (regster 1) where it would require multiple reboots after one rendered it inoperable. I investigated this issue which reproduced it and I removed the serial block adapter to fix the problem. All test ok.=408f6325-6674-44fb-bf9c-494d9bbd71f1 =40978a2b-e2c2-4383-a7ed-7bd4906fdde1 13-13.5 10 miles=034241d8-7136-4df3-a4ed-2d7702fb9856 13.5-=7b301762-9a2d-4a05-bff9-f0f5c71833a8 240401-0542=c98b07c5-a0c8-408c-83d7-68f70bf0f949 1941 Statesville RD=dedac3d1-22ec-424d-a148-b72c420a8da7 Wiljesboro NC, 28697=888af059-2db3-4161-b1b2-049925deee26 RUN IN #106=034fea04-8eb3-4fc7-8aba-f5c6c07487a5 =a90329cb-1a03-4d61-8efc-75090c811ae7 Upon arriving on-site, an initial assessment revealed issues with the Diesel dispenser. After consulting both the cashier and the neighboring construction team, it was discovered that the Diesel dispenser's malfunction was due to the construction team accidentally snagging the line with their grading equipment. They were already in the process of conducting repairs.=ff3857f0-6ba7-403d-83d0-602c356bec9f =1cb971d4-bdf0-44eb-be8b-483d5375b4be To ensure safety and facilitate the repair process, I de-energized the relevant systems and informed the construction team about the specific breaker I had turned off. This would allow them to safely re-energize it along with the other systems once their work was completed. At the time of my visit, the construction team had disassembled both electrical panels as part of their effort to trace and rectify the electrical issues caused by the snag.=5cb70cf1-f50f-4b46-8183-b1c696d58a25 =1e7a36dd-cd17-4f17-b536-fdddf52d3a5e I requested the construction team to contact us immediately if the dispenser fails to function correctly once it is brought back online, to ensure any further necessary repairs or adjustments could be swiftly addressed.=9ccc5ca7-2d1b-4966-b2b5-3ed2326beda9 =d61fc0a6-7892-472c-b67f-5b377fc5efbf =be8b456a-f4d5-479e-9753-9123583e01c5 =2d396882-02c2-4d67-b114-8ca1371030ae =801d0ab8-f57b-4c88-af53-87c94841020e =d97b88aa-dcd1-489c-a696-718a5273aaf5 =c2c35c7c-f9fe-489a-bb99-aa47d510ea91 =c6759db9-fbfe-432d-a4de-8f9d88ef1b55 =b4391535-a999-48e9-bece-de043c74c0cc
