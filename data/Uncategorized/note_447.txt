Only Dispenser 15 was bagged when I arrived. The manager stated that he had several positions down earlier some with please pay inside on the CRIND displays. Others would not allow grade selection and 15 would reset but not dispense. I tested 15, found and repaired by fully connecting the breakaway. someone had put it together loosly. I then tested for leaks. All test ok.=c8c7f546-4a81-41fa-ba8e-56f041f9964a =138ea317-c0c7-4a50-9209-e947966c4c97VMS - 131029=e54d9009-601a-4f2c-81a7-c162fb829d78PO - 183804180=009efae0-a986-471d-a9e9-3eaefe4212cf =22cf2b41-91ad-4668-bc94-3aa2c15bbade13.25 -14 RTT=8c2bcb60-e95a-4242-8aa4-07655ff430be14 - 18.5 RTL=311807ef-d9f5-4de1-8a3c-c1b3befbadcd18.5 - 19 RTTDH=f41427c3-f6d7-426a-9d8c-c8f09e651ac8=6e7889ca-3f53-44ef-84a8-c6e4028e3e33RT 99=f67a30dd-3569-4bc8-a036-4cd31fe857d51100 W Park BLVD=59d3c892-b99c-4426-b7c1-0b685a243e18Plano=0e071105-6903-4221-9c78-3b7efbba6b86  EN00175907=953e55aa-3425-4eaa-a090-998400f939d4  GVRID 107215=846d6674-e87e-42e4-86c0-7cf49a6b3464  NCR ticket # i0000313166956=3af447c3-8982-45a7-81a9-583d572cf899 =f81f1974-f178-4302-b435-c5c35664f6cf Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. Manager could not say with certainty but him and I believe FP 23/24 are the ones called in about. FP 21 has a leaky nozzle which I replaced using RT stock. I found 23/24 both to have activation required on the screen and the PPU's have no Prices and are flashing blends not programmed error code. I checked the logs on this PCN to find that nothing has been setup on this dispenser since it was commissioned one month ago. I programmed the dispenser PCN,OMNIA and both UPMS. I performed TLS and RKL procedures for both sides. I contacted NOC and registered the MAC address of the OMNIA. I registered the OMNIA with Insite 360 I contacted RTSS and we rebooted the controller 2 times. The CRINDs remained offline still. The D-box boards left in the BRCM by Jones Brothers are flashing all 12 channels 6/6 and RTSS can see everything is online and working just the ICR's are offline with the NCR equipment. We believe this is because NCR has not configured the site properly for this Fueling position likely because it was offline during the dispenser swap out. I got a NCR ticket from RTSS and contacted NCR ( i0000313166956) and left my number for them to call me back and the RT rep emailed them. After waiting for over 30 minutes I closed out the ticket as completed and will assist remotely should they call tonight, but I can not justify waiting for NCR any longer. Everything is good on our end. The regular hose on FP24 is leaking and neither the site nor myself have any hoses on hand. 21 and 22 also have leaking hoses and I installed a nozzle on FP21 REGULAR because of leak from spout. provided by RT manager. All test ok. =62e82e5a-fdb1-44cf-8440-ee55af9cdfa7 =feac2a8c-88f2-44c2-a8aa-9fc80b1d3161 =8488aace-0334-453f-a74d-897c182f5f6c 43.75=7e2a46f7-6a6b-4da5-8284-5f975965310d =cc48c985-1245-440a-a6e3-acaa00a92e4c 48.75=7e33085e-d94e-4c32-aeee-9f48a4af0cd5 =b3a74e70-f6fe-42af-b263-4374ba4f0bf0 =3c5ab3fa-abaf-4d54-a6f5-79b7c3f5a06d 92.5=5454a322-d36a-4019-8790-2aa28ebefef2 =45bf9172-b9bd-406f-a02a-12df739f85d7 80 - 2480=e6be6cbc-c1c3-4dd5-84c4-1413fef1061e 12.5 - 581.25=758199ea-53ac-47d7-a3db-453012931d34 =2d916a31-0711-4809-b726-bfd43b63724d 3061.25=c81a3c53-f0ad-47be-b50f-39db078e623d 918.375 (30%) - = 2142.87
