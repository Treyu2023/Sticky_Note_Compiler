I reconnected breakaway on FP6 & dispensed product to check for leaks. All test ok. Site has multiple printer issues on Wayne Ovation dispensers incompleting ticket as need parts for FP 2,5,6,7,8 &12. The price sign had to be manually updated when a customer brought to our attention that it was not matching the dispensers. It was off by 1 cent.=localId_aa5523e36ae049b19442743f0f2b8c1f =localId_5992a00c4d0b414a926b3125aca5a6dc 12.5-13.5=localId_2b33b65204504bdbad3802ec88d94caf 13.5-15.75=localId_fb6032a3386d44eeaa6d4ad4eba93913 15.75-17=localId_9c2fdc9aba514a4cabcf4a6481df2c65 139101=localId_459edeb0241e42a0a98b4d15c80d1027 211285942=localId_17a8b35a87b544eb85c274b4dd5e3f02 =localId_9db1ac1fb7034486b8377f6dd53effff Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. The port on the switch that the ATG was plugged into was amber. I reconfigured Ethernet port 2 om the Veeder Root & disabled port 1. This got the light green. I contacted RTSS several times and kept getting call dropped in transfers. Eventually I got through to just NOC to confirm atg polling. I then reconfigured port 1 back and moved the cable to port 1 and had to reboot the Veeder Root. I called back the ATG was now polling verified volumes. All test ok. =localId_f55988975b684c5c955c1c08f8b19deb =localId_f7fbec57361f4d249d99c2a157583437 =localId_77ee0fdff9014e16822bb3471f77462d 15.75-
