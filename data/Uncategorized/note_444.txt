The hinge was previously repaired but Because of the fact the dispenser is missing the lower left latching portion the fabricated hinge and the key lock are enduring unintended strain. I made adjustments to compensate this issue.  I have got it working again for now, but ultimately we need to just order a replacement cabinet door. That would be my recomendation.=4748cea2-4087-49ef-9930-2021b43238cf =d0871f9f-378f-4e76-a6cd-018e98806c36 VMS - 132040=bc4d759b-b53d-41c4-a213-f31b1a36bc08 =a2729621-72ca-419d-b3bb-49e0537b1e08 12.25 - 13.25=51b04769-7eec-467b-b41e-88df1c42473c 13.25 - 14.25=61c8aac5-bc45-4cce-abd3-bb32b79804be =3414f703-3f0b-4614-9964-494771c75f67 Homeboys=15b27a1d-cfa9-4631-960e-7de4b16db7d1 Garland=34e642d8-07c9-4dbc-97a7-6d8feb73b929 =54d5a5d1-8b7d-4002-9b66-b0ba31b3fb95 The contactless was not working, but these settings are controlled by Shell and have nothing to do with Upgrade yesterday.

Tested FP 10 and found the softkey on the right side of the screen was causing transactions to cancel when rewards Yes/No prompt selection was made. I replaced the keypad and overlay. The E-85 Nozzle was constantly shutting off cause the shutoff valve had been separated from the spout. I replaced the nozzle with RT provided part.
