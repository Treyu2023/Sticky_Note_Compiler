I met with Fernando and together we worked to check the calibration of the regular on every dispenser. i have included a list of the readings before they were set to 0. Additionally we checked the blend ratio on every dispenser and found FP 9 and 10 were set to 65/35 blend ratio and were also out of calibration more than any other position. we ran slow flow tests on mid grade after each calibration to ensure that there was not meter drifts. All test ok.=0d42229f-4114-46ec-8e6e-37d631eb0fcd =13b2447b-ca60-4d71-8470-1b7b584d2e9a 1/+2=d1014a17-3887-4efd-a0e8-5460b3453301 2/+1=277edf88-ba85-41d1-9d04-c2feb4da9856 3/0=48378beb-98bb-4b1e-af3e-1d94bad85af8 4/+3=93fe1ed4-7ffe-4d5e-9980-80e4c31c476d 5/-1.75=2018f3b2-a909-490a-9d4b-65fa31a7fbd1 6/+2.25=92a0b06c-286a-432a-a80f-3c273f52ce45 7/+3=95760922-0ad9-43f6-814a-288869ff56dd 8/+4.75=ac7909da-5bd0-4b62-b8db-bd157a478889 9/+1=ada57abd-cd30-4b0d-8449-73c4da42c27a 10/+10
