The site informed me that this particular issue had been experienced and addressed previously. Upon investigation, I determined that the PIN Pad was exhibiting a known software glitch resulting in blank screens and an "Ernno 2" error message. The existing software on the Commander was version 3.12.40. I proceeded to upgrade the PIN Pad software to version 4.07.10, which includes a solution for this specific issue. After the upgrade, I conducted both contact and contactless tests. All tests concluded successfully without issues.=cf874497-7c8a-4d6c-9b8a-81e0bbf73692 =7ff23130-a68f-405b-a2c7-dc047d01ec78 11.75-13.75 60 miles=0e1428c9-f030-4e93-82ce-0da7cbd6cbb3 13.75-14.75=82974c82-5505-4891-ab1d-c33e0f04182c 14.75-15.5 30 miles=663749d8-9d30-49b0-82e3-02b048b9edcf 230808-0176=97a27897-651b-491c-b21c-11510a754e68 Quick & Easy #8=98310e4f-54ab-404a-a5b1-e2987ab3668a 4191 OLD Hwy 421=fb26d935-80c3-408f-8745-5024dca7a067 1836 Elmer Moore Rd=ef16f57b-7039-4190-90aa-9daebca8c789 Siler City NC, 27344=ee7bce66-4e31-4b01-b802-76b686865368 C6652990=4cb5cfae-9459-4e23-a3b2-a4dbe9abc02a =a079e214-e0b5-48f8-a7d3-ff9eb9225ca9 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). Register 1 displayed an error stating it couldn't start. I reloaded the register system and, post-restart, executed a transaction test. I noticed the scanner was not functioning initially, prompting me to reconfigure the scanner and its associated port for compatibility. After making these adjustments, I successfully conducted a card transaction test. All systems are now functioning properly.=6736b7e8-c877-460c-8d2e-bce2eed0b408 =b8645d06-ee63-4fa3-b134-3ab6efd35cb7 =e5582518-a790-43ab-bbe7-c1360796f101 =a056d4e0-5e1f-4ed5-8df1-f3952079a39e =70665fa6-b7a4-4299-9f04-d5e7aa4d28ec =4d2e4044-fdfc-454c-be72-b6fe4ca890b0 =c1ff76ae-ea99-4ec2-92e8-904388434519 =309169db-f3b0-490f-825b-648d519614a9 =838f5e60-74c7-40a9-8f0f-5988b1110b01 =0289e3ef-eebd-4447-8215-c2465f74e524 =b99df9af-098a-4260-9d19-b6f16ac14937 =f212682d-3db9-4d8f-a252-7ddaf12a4eb5 =c33d1344-2107-4b65-b524-e5608800be7d =75ea17ce-5b4c-4bd9-b17e-25d25ae6479d =78f3ba9e-9c95-43a3-8d41-bc5216a3b665 =9b4157fa-e9b2-4dcd-baa0-a4af4d7ac091
