It is likely that the root cause is related to moisture infiltration in the sensor's infrastructure rather than a fault with the sensor itself.=188efd0d-4b1d-4769-90d7-1dd0df68fed8 Recommendations:=ae9485f9-d611-4d7d-a4da-f09ced8ba503 Close monitoring of the sensor and related infrastructure is advised to pinpoint any recurring issues. Further investigation may be required if the alarm reactivates, focusing on junctions and conduits for moisture ingress.=6711aa80-1b5c-4639-87af-5e9600d729ef =d88bf22a-ab74-48a1-81ff-b83edf50f5d8 =86b99d1f-b91d-4dee-8390-bc29c1c51e41
