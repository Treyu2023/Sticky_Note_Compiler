The old one was continuously running the motor with or without a hook signal but the new one does not have interchangeable Relay board. FP 3/4 was bagged because they diagnosed during reboot. FP 14 had remove card message stuck on CRIND. I rebooted and it came up to CRIND BIOS. I then offered for the manager to perform the controller reset during less busy time, she declined. I then waited for oppourtunity to call store support and have them reset the controller. This corrected the issue with 14.

I believe it was just not on well enough. I reconnected the cable and rebooted then tested the dispenser. This corrected the issue.

Arrived on site and checked in with SC. Spoke to the cashier and manager and found they were having issues with two PIN Pads one of them was on a separate ticket and mention of corporate involvement caused me to decline working on it today. I removed the serial dongle (Candy Bar) from the PIN Pad and ran both the power cable and the ethernet cable directly to the PIN Pad. I noticed this PIN Pad stand was not attached to the counter the screws had been sheared off and someone had previously mounted a base to it with security screws. I removed the base and mounted it to the counter with self tapping screws. I then mounted the stand back onto the base securing it to the counter.

I investigated the issue at the MAG VFC and ATG. I found that Diesel Q:6 (Back Row) was showing SC. I followed the troubleshooting to find the motor and wiring were not bad. Checked amps for both DSL STP multiple times. Set both DSL Mag VFC SW3 (Switch bank 3) SW-1&2 to the off position. For PLLD/DSL respectively. While this increased amp draw slightly they were both within +/- 5% of eachother further confirming no issues with the motor and/or Wiring.=aba2044e-197a-4046-80ee-802c96f0c1b2 =0ae4c4d8-2e63-4798-a79f-04d4c6bedd57 =3adfde57-6406-4f2d-94f3-3ef9a3f14366 s     2=86533cfa-6748-40a9-8633-9f9414b42b10 m    9.5     11.5=5656fe8a-2edb-458f-98d4-994f19ad7c28 t     8         19.5=36d28128-0dfd-4ab3-be83-55f1fca41958 w    8.5      28=1f7a3567-2465-45e9-a85a-673d9a6c3b9d t     14       42=c4f82ae8-8ece-4040-b1c1-9a1636087ba9 f     6.5      48.5 51.25  (99.75)=ca43975a-f6c3-4dc5-8213-f8830dde0739 s     =57b9e067-1e6b-418b-bfb7-395e542bd4d6 =9ecdc92b-8cfd-480e-8f51-80d2d8308670 =38ffea3e-783e-4a56-8244-b38a83bde68d =a7372498-988b-48a0-8fc8-ac6b7ecb1017 =d6ec0a76-8a23-410f-8e23-e89d7cc2048a =0a111c39-941f-4f7a-ad99-a28c3bfbcf73 =efc062c1-5a09-47cd-9184-03fe7f6540f2 =556e3ea3-a0d2-4eb8-b37e-77f8ae352738 =dd973f7f-5cf2-4a9f-8720-d7dc9efeb25b =efeecf32-c6d5-4e6d-b52f-0c0129d81e16 =0ad9fc8d-2edd-4d16-a654-c2c830e47f41 =d4d4f5b4-9ecc-4014-bd39-e09eaf449ab1 =98276463-8dde-4a05-b8b8-207ffbb235aa =70e42d0d-c09e-4800-ab2e-a3d77631ae61 =67d24b87-1448-459e-9d33-56d60a1d8201 =401559c8-def0-4a2e-bb1b-3f34f0e87766 =b0898204-1594-4ec3-9116-82c5b62f72cf
