The attendant informed me that they had just resolved the issue with the registers by rebooting them before I arrived. The issue described was a locking up problem affecting both registers, and the reset button was not functioning properly. However, with assistance from Gilbarco over the phone, the attendant was able to successfully go through the reboot procedure.=437b3420-5a6f-4c95-b3b6-97a4435d83e3 =64b8e788-d7d8-4d93-8808-32358573b654 To further investigate, I had the attendant log into register one (she was operating register 2), where I ran a mock transaction on dispenser 1. Currently, everything seems to be functioning as expected. All tests are OK. Therefore, no immediate action was necessary during this visit, and I would recommend continued monitoring to ensure that the problem does not reoccur.=4f025ce8-d2f9-48f9-b819-a20205e7ff54 =8d3052ab-8f5a-4da9-aa14-a6c1c1d19abd 10.75-11 25 miles=2aa6e25d-33fa-4e6d-b2eb-b39f8fe5c761 11-12=d52d5e8e-1d26-4753-a23d-0b62f0e50c95 230706-0204=854cf927-1b8d-4556-ad35-dbafa8752dd0 The Pop Shoppe=609084f8-363c-408f-bd44-d8cbc87184d8 7340 W Friendly Ave=306fbaae-39a7-41f5-a99f-c9a32244085a =6d5d2257-6f3e-44d9-b053-cdc0317437b4 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with Jack. Fuel Pump (FP) 1 was exhibiting a door sensor alarm on the Price Per Unit (PPU) displays. This usually signals an issue with the door security settings. After checking these settings and finding them to be correct, I conducted further troubleshooting. I discovered that the issue was being caused by the door switch for the printer door.=a7340126-cfaa-4032-aa38-cde34155d1fc =a5058523-6ccd-45d0-a8b5-881ea4107a08 The printer door switches, which are not in use, were mounted in such a way that they were not compatible with the operation of the printer door. To rectify the issue, I adjusted the printer door switch to silence the alarm. After completing these adjustments, I monitored the fuel pump for a short period to ensure that the alarm did not reoccur. All tests were satisfactory, and no further issues were identified during my visit.=ece36413-b478-4fce-8829-1a7f96a04c52 =824d2e43-4728-46f7-9c12-ef77b49892bc =3c9bc884-2840-4360-b5b0-17d3a0a4e36a 12-12.25 50 miles=c0be48c0-9896-48e1-8124-2261ddd0132b 12.25-14.5=9f8c2d54-c548-4eac-bdfe-22c8bde7c2ff 230710-0259=051c3535-119b-44f1-9839-faf837f74a78 Smile Mart=c545324e-75da-49fc-aa75-2507f69aa43e 5668 West Market St=b131d04d-15bd-4870-9f3e-3c2ddfd01ad7 Greensboro NC 27409=d82590c6-1c0c-4baf-9d3a-e444e9debd72 =58837135-6b4d-44f0-87e3-5c068f62864f Arrived on-site, the register was on a boot screen saying there was a problem with the system. rebooting made no change. I reloaded the software (HPS1.15.40) on the register.
