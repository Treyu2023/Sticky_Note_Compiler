Security devices have been installed at this site adding to the time it takes to access each dispenser. I checked all pulsers and linkages at the site. A few bottom doors were ajar. I had to repair the latch on #3 due to tampering. I removed a broken key on the lower door for FP5. No evidence of pulser tampering was found.

FP12 was offline with POS, no signs of tampering were evident the Diesel only on FP12 was slow. I changed the proportional valve and tested the Hanging Hardware. This helped but 12 is still significantly slower than FP11 Diesel. (Site has Eco Meters) FP 3/4 the diesel was slow on both sides. I changed the filter and saw no change. Site is going to need Diesel tanks and lines cleaned and the Eco Meters replaced at some point. No tampering detected.

I found the site's dispensers were online but EPS unavailable whenever a card was ran inside. I rebooted the Commander and the Wincor devices. Once complete this restored card functions to the site. All test ok.
