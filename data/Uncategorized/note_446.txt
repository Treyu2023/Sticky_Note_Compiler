I noticed that the screen appeared to be devoid of power, so I first replaced the PIP3, followed by the screen itself, although neither action restored power. I subsequently discovered that the UPM was locked up.=9e4a0a95-c999-4c9b-9444-25c4933cb861 =c472b982-2ce6-44c8-8236-d5553a63452f While this typically doesn't result in a power cut to the screen (which would normally display either a white screen or hang on BIOS with a black background), I proceeded to replace the UPM. Afterward, I returned the screen and PIP3 to their original components, with the screen maintaining functionality.=1834d967-975c-422f-bdcd-46df30e780f5 =aebec8bc-1b3d-45bc-aeab-beaaa30503be Following this, I programmed the UPM and loaded the necessary software, alongside the Remote Key Loading (RKL) with UDS2 Key for debit transactions. Upon testing an EMV debit transaction at the dispenser, everything functioned as expected. All tests were successfully executed.=d0575bbb-921b-47e8-8f3e-847958db4f30 =cc09e8ba-a387-48e0-b7a8-3152d6fda1e7 =58b5906c-3ed6-4fe8-8957-c037cfd7ecef 13.25-14 38 miles=8db79e49-90bb-492b-ae0a-3047d07db37b 14-14.5=6a0f4ef8-7c37-4847-a34c-ce97f3af1fd7 14.5-16.75 131 miles=e27d7f2f-7d17-42cd-9ba4-b6afe6a6964a 230516-0231=58d38920-4d39-4232-8c8a-dd589623104c Fast Phils #145=38b4ed2f-37c2-4eed-8afd-5df6e0ed8db5 2443 w nc hwy 10 =6742ce6a-43c8-43f4-b1b2-0876f0c4e0d7 newton 28658=0df0a4c5-77f0-4bae-9ef0-da73ec6a974a EN445702=23eb0325-b263-4ffa-88bd-32e465a6d68e =0679448b-be92-4c4b-8842-9e901a64ccd8 Upon arrival at the site, I promptly checked in with the Manager On Duty. I proceeded to diagnose the Customer-Activated Terminal, which was displaying a white screen, indicative of a potential issue. After a thorough troubleshooting process, I determined that the Universal Pumping Module (UPM) was faulty.=791ecd9e-8100-4b57-857a-a03d49a64cf0 =20b724a8-196f-4283-9f99-306315b99fb8 Regrettably, I had just utilized my last available UPM at a previous assignment at Fast Phil's. As such, a new one will need to be ordered for this location. I am initiating an order for part number M13888K901 to rectify this issue.=697ffbf5-ebbf-413b-88e1-69464cef537f =50240468-ef40-4db3-896b-b15fe983f3d7 Consequently, I am placing the necessary call to reserve this part. Once the part arrives, we will proceed with the necessary repair work. As of now, my work at this site is completed, pending the arrival of the ordered part.=c3c4f171-87c9-4fd2-8934-b587f6ec009f =80a70ed3-3830-4b93-be04-db41f0d2164d =1f3bb9c1-6502-4537-88c4-09a80176f95d =92841364-15cc-41a7-a89e-53d61d29c2e8 =35363c22-8a23-458b-a758-c5a3aeb95ed0 =21c5051b-1513-4997-9a01-e8ace1272881 =723f5133-5534-483a-ad8c-ad71500a0a6f
