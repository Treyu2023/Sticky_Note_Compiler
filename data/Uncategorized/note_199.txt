Together, we embarked on the task of removing the dispenser from the island and installing new wire to dispenser numbers 1 & 2. After we completed this task, I headed back to the shop to procure the necessary parts that were needed for the dispenser which, after preliminary troubleshooting, seemed to be malfunctioning.=843adcf6-fd8a-4894-a31a-ff792a93a9ba =5e024293-abc7-4216-9da5-f671fc1245b8 Upon my return, I proceeded to install these parts, but unfortunately, we were still facing issues that prevented the dispensers from coming online. I consulted with the admin team on this matter and we collectively agreed on procuring a second DCM 2.2 for dispenser numbers 3 & 4. We also discussed the possibility of replacing the BRCM 2 SSoM/Homeplug portion.=72dcb1d4-3ad5-4768-a3cd-05dae81a616b =f426c817-b672-43d3-9cb0-711b5edad041 To ensure prompt attention to this matter, parts will be shipped in from Charlotte and we plan to return first thing in the morning to continue addressing these issues.
