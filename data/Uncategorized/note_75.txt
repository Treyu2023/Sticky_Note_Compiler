Called previous technician and got up to speed. I cleared the sale which forced the 2am Monday reboot to proceed taking down the site. Whole this happened I located the Security Manager Report and contacted GVR TAC. I went ahead and purged the fuel files. Tac explained that this is likely a dispenser issue. That being said I moved the PCN from 11/12 to dispenser 9/10 and vice versa.

I tried rebooting one dispenser and purging another. Most are on blank blue screen. I have seen customers use cards afterwards it sticks on remove card until it went to blank screen. I have not confirmed wether any cards have worked. I connected to the Omnia and UPMs on one position and reloaded the software.  At this point I noticed even the card readers that looked OK we're in fact also not working. I shut down the site and rebooted the panther this returned all screens to normal state on testing cards contact with EMV debit would process without pin and work. 3 and 4 that I reloaded would go to the secure prompt on debit transaction but display in a different language and would time out. I contacted racetrack store support they put an NCR ticket Inform me. Ticket number INC 00016045086. I'm waiting for NCR to call together with troubleshot issue down to just contact EMV debit transactions. He didn't ask that I wait for a call from  Tier 2. Once I explained issue again the tier 2 rib copied and pasted ICR config files from another site, at which point debit was working. I monitored for a few customers.
