I tested a Wells Fargo EMV Debit transaction at dispenser #2, without issue. I spoke to site personnel & they explained the issue is on all dispensers and only affecting certain cards. I contacted 711 HD & after being on the phone for almost 2 hours I finally got in touch with Donald at 711 Production Support Team. After some troubleshooting we determined Chris Werley had worked on FP 3/4 and may have inadvertently configured the CRIND incorrectly to enable "700 Compatability" n FP 3 which affected the prompts in a way that disabled EMV cards used at the dispenser. I made corrections rebooted the DEX and tested EMV on FP 3.

I ran line test from ATG. I tested a dispenser  I tried to get more information from the site. When I mentioned the site was called in at 12:15 PM today by a Tyasia Askew the manager insisted that this call did not originate from this site, even though the address was correct. I contacted RTSS & the rep told me Tyasia Askew is with the helpdesk. After a brief hold where she spoke directly to her she had me to complete and close call. The rep stated there was an error on their end.

I noticed right off that port 24 on the switch was amber instead of green. I checked the cable, veeder root port settings and tried different ports on the switch before contacting NOC. Together we programmed port 2 on the ATG and swapped the cable which gave us a green light on the switch, but NOC eas still unable to poll the ATG. At this point I reverted all changes and roped off the forecourt to reboot the ATG. This corrected the issue.
