He explained that they had a stuck sale on FP 1, they had the Registration issue popping up and they have an issue with their daily report not showing network transaction totals for Cards (Showing 13.00 and should be 175.00. I added a stop fuel and prepay fuel button to screen to clear stuck sales and chowed the attendant how to use them to clear a sale. I wrote down directions for this procedure and left them at the site per managers instruction. I gathered registration information from register and performed registration through Verifones Premier Portal. I also removed dispensers 5-8 and cleared them from the screen. I checked the report configuration, but the issue with the reports not showing all card data and the prepay issue from yesterday are one in the same. They rebooted the CI and this cleared up the problems they were having but I think the Card data stored for the time leading up to reboot may have been corrupted and is not recoverable from the POS that I knw of.
