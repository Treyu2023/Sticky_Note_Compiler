The persisting issue with the offline card readers, which continued from the previous night despite the efforts of our technician, was found to be related to the BRCM (Broadcom Router Control Module).=cc1e91e8-588c-401c-9939-c2c2bd503891 =ba8db87c-a450-462c-bfb3-4cf38737286f Chris Poplin from Sampson Bladen was already on-site when I arrived, and he had narrowed the problem down to the BRCM. During his troubleshooting process, he swapped the Ethernet cable from the back to the front counter and replaced the FCI current loop board. Verifone recommended a software upgrade on the system, which Chris stated that Sampson Bladen would handle.=bb154c27-b331-48ce-bb20-83d5b2f01676 =3b999474-30fe-478d-aa81-7232189ad2ce In an effort to resolve the issue, I arranged for Corey to bring a replacement BRCM 2 from our shop. Unfortunately, the issue persisted after the new BRCM was installed. We then had Corey retrieve a Commander from the shop while Chris and I attempted to reload the existing one with a newer software version. However, this did not rectify the problem either.=bf7b6fd3-9973-494d-a068-5bd141fd6f71 =34478c53-d50d-44b4-9687-edd1a7d59eb9 Further troubleshooting revealed that both cables that had been swapped were faulty. Additionally, a spare cable in the conduit also proved to be defective. Consequently, we ran a new 100ft Ethernet cable through the ceiling since three cables in the conduit running through the floor were found to be faulty.=b1b91d68-17a4-40e9-8ab7-2383f004a621 =3487c3a8-64a4-43c4-a8ec-45066be89edd Once all other equipment was removed, save for the Ethernet cable brought during today's visit, the issue was finally resolved. All subsequent tests performed were satisfactory.
