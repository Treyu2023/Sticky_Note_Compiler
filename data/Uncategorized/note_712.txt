I worked to install the parts sent with and had to have more parts brought to the site. I waited on Jamie to bring parts and put those in but still could not get the communication to work betweeen the pump node and the Money Volume Boards. I spoke with TAC and found that the software we were using is not correct for the hardware at the site and the correct software can only be obtained by using the new modifier on the update tool so when we refreshed earlier and loaded the latest it in fact was not the latest release. Once corrected the nre PCN repaired the problem and then we were able to calibrate the site. They are still lacking octane stickers for the dispensers and commissioning of the dispensers. The site has some temporary signs in place for the octane. =a8d84239-f961-40ec-96dc-5037091702e3 =00e1b5d0-57b2-445f-8cd2-7161e79d6906 =716a9adc-c672-48ec-8f75-805d593ece9f =484718d0-2a4d-4aba-baf7-fcceff482606 =4a0b8194-9930-42c9-8fae-48156ef47dcb
