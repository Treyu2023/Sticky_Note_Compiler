FP8 the manager stated was still leaking after nozzle has been replaced. I replaced the noz9zle and the REG Prop valve for this position. On testing the grade selects would not work. I swapped the Door node before replacing the PPU boards. There was a water line across the tray and each board this door had extensive water damage. After opening FP 8 I discovered it is still leaking. I swapped the valve I took off the regular for the premium valve, but thte problem still persisted. Needs Hydraulic interface board. FP #5 I replaced the UPM. I upgraded the software to match other side 42.11.22 EMV 3.09. I upgraded the SSoM software and configured Insite 360 settings for FP 5/6 and registered the dispenser with insite 360. I downloaded TLS certificates and RKL'd the UPM. I tested debit transaction. All test ok.=95775a09-f9c1-4597-bf87-32f09c90ba6e =e89ecb91-7c63-4398-b891-232b28a2e16a T14-1rrived4.5 M11=72f1021a-2c73-4c67-ad7b-7aa12d2f4e7a 14.5-16.5=414bc120-ed35-48ca-b1c0-7379c1c85bcd T16.5-17.5 26M=ddf7ade2-c53e-4f37-b038-6706f7fc3ae9 21020-0211=80067354-83c7-4c63-bba0-35e030e85e9f Wawa 5131=03fdcaac-49a0-4f19-9cc7-b02d1d680237 7305 Curry Ford Rd=48483aa0-d032-492c-a6f4-b8ed1f9ce00b Orlando 32822=ed9435a6-51f9-4991-8c04-15bee0f61b86 PO - 14420418=23583b65-20aa-45e8-9c9c-2dcdfeec4243 =f219cfd1-1850-40b3-b141-626db99e373a Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD and investigated the L21 alarm on the VR. This alarm was for the Premium FIll Sump. It was stating high liquid and short simultaneously. I had to disassemble the Premium fill and vapor recovery spill buckets to access the sump primary containment where the sensor is located. I removed the sensor and cleaned the plug. I let it stand out for a minute to dry off. Once I reinstalled it and re-assembled the cover I watied for 15 minutes for the alarms to clear on the VR. All test ok.
