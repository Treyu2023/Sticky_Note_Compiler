It was brought to my attention that Fuel Pumps (FP) numbered 1, 2, and 3 had all been rejected by the state due to regulatory non-compliance related to the malfunctioning of the Point of Purchase Units (PPU) under Regulation PPU INOP. Upon conducting a thorough troubleshooting analysis, it became apparent that the PPUs were rendered unreadable as a result of a combination of inoperative backlights and sun damage to the PPU boards.=e651d67e-7d03-4b8a-b1d5-f940d43791d3 =2057e261-ed41-402a-bb63-11d70a1e195c To rectify this issue, I have initiated the procurement process for the acquisition of five new PPU boards and eight replacement backlights. Furthermore, I successfully identified the UX300 as the underlying cause of the Card Reader Indication (CRIND) problem specifically affecting FP#1. However, despite my recommendation for a replacement, the customer has chosen to decline this option. As a result, I am currently placing a call on hold for the required replacement parts.=4c67b5a8-de7f-48db-b090-f4e4e2c5d751
