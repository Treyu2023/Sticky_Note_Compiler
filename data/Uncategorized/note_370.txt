I tried to reload the software on the MX PIN Pad but was unable to successfully test. I replaced with 2 on my truck and one would not power on and the other was giving me a maintenance required message on power up. I contacted Office and had another tech bring one from the branch warehouse. We installed and configured the new MX915 PIN Pad and injected the encryption key. Afterwards the PIN Pard was donig the same thing as the original and the one tristen tried yesterday. After discussion with AG the Owner and admin team we performed an auto upgrade procedure on the commander which also did not resolve the issue. We contacted the network and they flagged a PDL for the card table. After the PDL we were able to do contactless, but not contact EMV transactions on the PIN Pad inside. At this point it was getting pretty late, we again involved AG and admin team and made the call to pull off and return in the morning with a replacement Commander and try a full reload without using any of the auto procedures to avoid copying any corruption over with the reload. site is currently EMV contact and contactless outside and only contactless inside. Unfirtunateky due to time constraints this is where we have to leave it today.=60a5a4c1-e7ff-494f-a00c-fa290d50fa1b =0339c395-2989-4a36-a3aa-8fef266f75ab =8ff8e432-3396-4165-a199-c196372f6aa8 =47a5ab00-21ae-48a9-986c-034a36f84108 =41e298b0-aaea-4cfd-ac7b-ccd7b8c5ee70 WEB-002709950=e104a5fe-7750-471a-ab99-d93f05c6b706 =cc5da7cf-85a4-47f1-b848-10528e53681e =c089e230-6280-443f-adf0-19df05f2ce37 517115=c386a8c4-9040-4e37-aa32-60fc4ef98d13 =66faebd4-08da-4bc4-b4f7-d267e3694f56
