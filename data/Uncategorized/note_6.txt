I thoroughly examined for other leaks and determined this was an isolated incident. Customers successfully used the dispenser without issues.=4b8dae92-85ec-4628-9b84-c4ff6b7b3348 =c1f3cd99-b3dd-4eb0-a07f-50756ca6b395 I consulted with Becky and Jill, who witnessed the problem. They mentioned the leak started after dispensing 5-6 gallons of product. I conducted tests dispensing 14 gallons at full flow and 6 gallons at the first latch, but couldn't replicate the issue. As this is the third call for this concern, I decided to order and replace the air eliminator. Meanwhile, the dispenser remains operational in hopes that the issue may worsen and reveal itself.=6e2debc7-ebf4-4515-82b6-99099c3ef3e6 =f1cc0620-9be4-4799-ab5f-cd7b58663c96 =8932e800-049a-45e3-94ed-4cef36b80239 230502-0109=2de70055-75ae-495c-8a3f-9235d0d58359 Waughtown Grocery=449415e3-efe7-4ec9-a447-71323bb70616 900 Waughtown St=3d2a718f-ffd2-43cf-84c4-0ff21535f63b Winston Salem=61648ebd-7e73-4cd7-a7f9-171906d8c169 =0d3f6b98-8c72-45e7-ac3f-a13808d2c1a4 11.75-14   27+12 miles=bc4b8ed2-19a0-4241-9125-041742c9ad16 14-16=6030e4f1-df01-492a-a4b6-4e29bcf5889c 16-17.25 58 miles=2a4018ab-38c5-4bfb-b3a6-55ddf7ffb3b0 =e3cd03ac-bb68-4c9c-b36c-9d7aac9df39f Upon arriving at the shop, I first collected the necessary parts before proceeding to the site. Once there, I checked in with the site manager and began working on the dispenser repair, installing the pre-ordered components. However, it became apparent that the AFP board delivered did not match the part indicated on the box, and consequently, it was not compatible with the SSOM system used at the site. I have informed Jason from the parts department, and a new, correct part should be ordered promptly.=9e06f99e-e337-47be-9e61-00257347e7ea =8d3d2464-bbf9-49c8-bb61-64ce5c1f1c1e After replacing the digital valve and the damaged coil, I successfully cleared the 4352 error code. It came to my attention that a previous technician had replaced the display board on side A but failed to move the side A jumper. After identifying and resolving this issue, I confirmed that the display core is still functional within the dispenser. While the dispenser side is now operational, communication with the card readers will remain unsupported until an appropriate AFP/DCM/CCP board, compatible with the SSOM interface, is installed.=3dc9f263-5cca-4f57-b970-307cc59644b0 =c94bbae2-4488-4920-b374-c4128e1d8dda I conducted manual tests for fueling all available products, and all tests yielded satisfactory results=4bb4173c-02cb-4c4b-b41f-75c2a6337880 =484681f3-0851-4f25-9880-96eb5cf07e75 =bf2ce777-40eb-4138-8780-b7a457a47284 17.75-19 63 miles=696f1b9f-c6b6-49b9-b777-3ba33c77a2bc 19-21.25=909e224c-59a5-4e66-974c-79990c1ff4cb 21.25-22.5 63 miles=7192e51d-78c2-4f5f-a17f-0d1402d584e0 230504-0326=cc042d3a-a28b-438d-a322-07f853648bf6 =08c59093-1365-48d4-830b-5d15cbb459ca 4116 Indiana Ave=ec4802ef-ad0b-428b-9d12-6b756d1e99a4 Winston Salem 27105=5be2dfd0-5f85-46a7-8d13-0ed190c99986 =6d1a08b7-e8a3-49c4-add7-212d9a623a5f Upon arriving on-site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). Unfortunately, I failed to check in with the IVR system until 7:25. I encountered an issue where the customer attempted to make a purchase for one cent, but their card was declined. To resolve this, I rebooted the PIN Pad and successfully completed a transaction using my EMV Debit card. Subsequently, I observed multiple customers completing card transactions without any problems.=e6fc4ca3-1ce4-4cfd-ae29-bda35f8d501f =90659d69-e552-4df8-bb28-df8e02c50a38 I reached out to Mr. Patel, the owner, over the phone to gather more information and discussed the issue with the store manager. They informed me that another card reader was not functioning simultaneously with the primary register. I then contacted Shell Support, who in turn reached out to Cybera. After an approximate 20-minute wait, the Shell representative informed me they would follow up with their findings by calling me back Shell case #155303. I did not wait around the site for this call back.=fdfd4f7a-21a9-46b6-9132-0ce20ffc160a =b15352f0-afd0-418c-9e2d-5102754048fc I provided the manager with written instructions on what to check in case the issue reoccurs. During our conversation, the manager contradicted themselves, stating that the secondary PIN Pad was functioning when the main one was down this time. To troubleshoot this, I swapped the two PIN Pads to determine if the issue was with the device itself.=8196b1e4-832e-49d5-a9c2-3b7e4373f870 =670a3985-239e-4cb8-931b-04f743fb43b0 While performing the swap, I noticed that the primary register's PIN Pad had two Ethernet cables connected, one of which was plugged into the serial port used for loading software ( I have seen this cause issues before). I traced this cable back to the Cybera device, where it was not connected. As a precautionary measure, I disconnected the cable and left it unplugged.=4f7509ef-0cd3-4167-9463-4ee40b745530 =7b57b914-0014-4277-a240-d0b01c712c1c I am hopeful that these steps will help resolve the ongoing issues and improve the operational efficiency of the site. All tests conducted were satisfactory.=4e12fb74-0396-4c79-aeda-cc609dc64bae =aa78de71-e9be-4786-b37d-cbaccec376d1 During my drive home shell reached out to me over the phone and explained that the Cybera rep told her that typically the cybera should reboot once a month and the cybera at the site has not rebooted in 45 days. She also explained that teh Cybera rep told her that the site has been having internet issues as reported by the cybera logs and this should be looked into as a possible culprit. I tried to reach out to the site and get them to reboot their Cybera, but the phone number on the ticket is disconnected 3367440029. At this time theres nothing more I can do.=9760026d-f4c4-4011-b70c-05b381c9e116 =ede30cbc-f8f7-4b95-9a99-6fe7c9a9ea13 =6a91df09-f186-4079-a19b-0f2bdb35edb8 =9be253ea-9157-44ea-88e8-118881727a6b =ba10c96e-d1e7-4314-ad18-5bd980e5e889 =dd4b837b-15d3-489f-9ca0-46d046e73fcc
