FP 9 I was able to re-assign an IP to the UX300 restoring communications, but I kept getting error messages stating to only use one card. I then went into the options and turned off then back on the UX400 and purged the CRIND. I was then able to successfully test this CR and placed it in service. FP 6 is not allowking card insertion all the way everytime. I ordered a CR for this position. FP 13 was also bagged and I looked into it briefly before discussing with dispatch and found that 13 was but FP 6 is not on another ticket. I am closing this ticket as incomplete pending parts for FP 6. All test ok.
