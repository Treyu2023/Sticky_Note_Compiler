When I moved the printer it started printing reports. This carried on for a bit befor eI went into the printer que and cleared it of print jobs dating back to 06/2022. nce complete I was able to print a test page, but not any reports. The print jobs werent even showing up in the que after trying to print. I contacted TAC and we reinstalled the printer drivers and ran a few troubleshooting procedures. Finally the rep suggested I re-image the passport and try to print again after that . I re-imaged the server and restored from snapshot. afterwards the printer was still not working. While trouleshooting mr Patel Called the site and explained to me that there is some kindof confusion. He stated that he had called Guardian when he was having problems printing reports from his back office PC. I confirmed this is working now. Typically with PDF printers they show in windows printers and can be selected as default or not. the fact that it did not show up even TAC was confused by what we were seeing. This is because the Bullzip program does not create a selectable printer in windows and is not controlled by which printer has default status. Both printers are working. All test ok.=ab5d4d14-a722-4aac-99e5-8a7e824b9d5a =628f2c8e-83b1-498b-a1ea-290c872941d2 =c9e7f566-84e2-4a69-ae82-6c5ea26ff74d =c6c670f0-a492-4dea-b427-937fac3c0108 =17214ea0-0f04-40d9-a649-08d72d12cd3e =b9c0f62a-d8d6-4eab-91af-449eca486908 =0daf40af-e7b4-4e31-9333-50d0020c2b95 =710a7ef9-943c-45de-a693-31c54ed0a8ca =b9adbb2d-9896-46e9-920f-b17e69689741 =84b898e4-e3ef-436e-95c6-1daef2b82482 =33772fb1-4355-4e0c-b0bf-9432276bc195 =4294d56e-08de-4b94-ae2c-bcf9f64963e0 =d7154b6c-1e4e-4518-8110-75804a783e4d =ed827025-100f-4c88-8585-700c6609089a =3ee5d764-e4a9-4907-b6c8-0f3c73c6c459 =eee77608-cc67-4123-bf90-aea91b2beaf5
