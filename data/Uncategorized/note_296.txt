I restored power to the site controller clearing the server offline message in the process. I contacted RTSS after several attempts, together we cleared the EPS device status to normalcy. Call got dropped and after several more attempts I was unable to reach SS.Register 2 PIN Pad cable stays amber on the switch. I troubleshot issue to patch panel. Port 6 (front) to port 1 (back) has pins 5+6 shorted together. The only other available port 5 (front and back) has pin one severed. Cards are up and working outside. Inside the PIN pads are not communicating with POS.On reboot they hang at the point they should start communications with POS. I contacted Dispatch and waited for some time and kept trying to contact SS. When I got them on the line we performed more troubleshooting and contacted NOC. NOC suggested rebooting the switch. After this didn't work I gathered the Serial numbers of the 3 PIN Pads for them to order replacements and I was relieved and asked to close the ticket on my end. All work complete.=localId_7fde4cc8af434ecbbe1702d2294077a0 =localId_9a0a5a043d374cd29c68f86d15887d92 =localId_88b6187df5a34763b8f764c7b81d33a2 =localId_b8533f0c9dee4b17866a4a4f021d08a8 =localId_fc62244d523c4c07b2080ac969285e3f
