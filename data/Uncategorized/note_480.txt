I recognized the specific "Errno2" error, which is a known issue observed during Citgo site upgrades.=b42f4e06-fd46-457c-ac68-1a0f34654dfc =9878701b-b636-4bb1-bb0d-8cb72d5c35d7 I proceeded to the Verifone Premier Portal, where I downloaded the latest software for the MX915 model. I reloaded the OS, hotfix, contactless, and Viper Pay (4.07.10 on Point of Purchase (POP) 1. Once operational, I upgraded the software on the other PIN Pad, loading only Viper Pay 4.07.10 to prevent recurrence of this issue, as this appeared to be the only different file used and POP 2 was still working.=a6b53b23-b9f8-4f06-9504-ac7a1ed0a5d5 =24d2dfa1-1a1d-45b9-af4c-8e9c0df671ed After discussing with the site manager, it appeared that the outdoor contactless issue had been resolved with a reboot of the Commander system. I had the Verifone representative close both tickets accordingly. Furthermore, I ran the BRCM tool and updated one device, a likely resolution to another unrelated issue, that the manager described.=cb4559b2-b40a-4a4d-91c4-1f7480b75370 =5487585c-71e5-4841-8ab5-23dccdabf0dc I conducted thorough testing on both PIN Pads, including both contact and contactless EMV transactions, to ensure proper functioning before placing them back in service. All tests were successful, and the system is now fully operational.=eaa629d3-93bf-42b4-904f-424adf957ee7 =8ee19eec-18ca-498d-9f5c-8b95c8dd0dcb 13-14.5 94 miles=01633ff5-010e-451b-9086-44fcaea2adcd 14.5-16=947a6974-39b9-4731-bc5b-8970c78cba88 16-18 100 miles=95d0b12b-8e89-4dde-9a08-c0a0d04cf289 Sky Mart #7=04fa96b4-35ac-4be7-9e9f-8394a196bbae 3716 Virginia Ave=9ef6dc4c-7fcb-4aa8-9295-2b7d45f73f2e Collinsville VA 24078=4571de74-d865-41cc-b347-693ca2da06a7 =0b9f48a6-7c80-4331-8d64-9473b72f1868 Upon arrival on-site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and immediately began investigating the Network service interruption. I discovered that the site had covered their Firewall and switch with plastic bags, inhibiting proper ventilation. I promptly removed the bags and advised the staff to avoid covering these components, allowing them to breathe.=41ad4eb8-b714-4475-87e5-1be546c36ca6 =3bd33b09-3ba7-4bee-8ab4-9296cb04146b I noticed that some dispensers were offline, specifically the ones not in use. I rebooted the FCI box and isolated the unused dispensers on the current loop boards. Further investigation revealed that the payment NIC cable had become unplugged from the firewall router, likely due to the improper placement of the bags.=df2140b7-2a65-4235-a2c6-d0c2d8165488 =13d9f89d-1f20-4343-ab87-4425db3dd6e8 I contacted Control Scan (Echosat) to ensure the correct port was used according to the template loaded in the device. After making the necessary changes, I was able to run a card transaction in the store successfully.=52cfe9e6-e8ab-408e-a58e-ab6e722a5af5 =201f9353-b253-42b4-8104-711e6a042c03 I continued to monitor the site for a brief period to ensure that no other issues were present. With all tests coming back positive, the site is now fully operational, and I concluded my work on-site.=bfa5954e-d0c1-4e04-a7c3-f76a1ce2d391 =1e7472b0-e283-48ac-83a2-918187667816 =f8057a87-b8b7-4179-90a4-71ce6f21040b =7661008d-ce6d-46a7-903f-c00635fe3ee9 =aad84082-d3a6-44a2-9a8d-da8138f66f72 =85be3709-4df0-471d-9522-f6933b9d290c =f0e8bca8-1f1f-46fb-ae4b-151b580d28d9 =bdfce2a1-4e0a-49b1-b78e-8b398075e3c0 =0084d6a5-75cf-4529-9800-73454e5319bf =8addbb8f-8aa5-4e27-8647-65b005630546 =1fd1eb9f-e8f9-46ac-8b42-b1adddadd97a =54f5843c-99e5-4540-8553-1888aae2b0d2
