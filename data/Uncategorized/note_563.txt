However, the displays didn't function with this new board, leading me to suspect it might be faulty right out of the box. I reverted to the original board and reprogrammed the dispenser. However, shortly after, I noticed issues with the display, showing all lines on the money and volume segments. While attempting to troubleshoot this, there was a sudden power loss across the boards in the card tray, with the cause remaining unclear.=1f40837e-9118-495f-b4cb-93ea80f57c6a =0f54e1df-0a63-4572-a430-ad89dd91c401 I've communicated this issue to my service manager, who will be liaising with the site's regional manager about the next steps. As a precaution, I've gathered and ordered part numbers for various components, though without understanding the root cause of the power issue, repairs might not guarantee long-term functionality. The dispenser's age and exposure to the elements further complicate matters, potentially suggesting a broader underlying problem or the need for a more comprehensive solution.=2d8be02d-02bb-413e-9c4f-6905638398df =5abba601-5764-4f05-9f2a-b1032d7e518e Display - T16226-G1=be4eb797-4034-4ea6-93d8-ce511387cbcd Disp Cable - T16412 G1 Rev C=9aac62a4-3069-4066-86ed-6a31936e793f Power Reg Bd - T15857-G?

The ite was without power when I arrived. The power returned to the site while I was discussing with the manager about the issues they were having. I found out that the site does not have their security manager report or the Admin password to reprint the report. Once everythiing powered back up the Card readers came back online, I believe the issue was network related and a device needed to be rebooted. The power outtage did this for them restoring the card reader functionality in the process. I explained that the SMR issue should be addressed by scheduling the procedure during normal business hours and not waiting until after hours or in the middle of another emergency issue to streamline the process and keep costs down. I tested card readers and monitored the site for a bit to ensure everything was working properly. All test ok.=ca552c59-1538-4f76-8998-7ba4cacc075e
