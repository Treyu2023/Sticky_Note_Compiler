Could not check into IVR due to no PO on ticket. I handed off the PLLD and swiftcheck to the installation team and immediately worked on the CRINDs down issue. I found the SSoM board on 9/10 had came unplugged and fell behind the CCP/DCM board. I corrected this issue and checked the programming once I re-installed. Afterwards I was able to get the CRINDs up, FP 9/10 during repairs got a little wet from the rain despite my best efforts to keep it dry. After some time of letting it dry I was able to cycle it and it came online. I opened 7-12 and monitored fueling operations for a bit until the install team returned from lunch and could move the vehicles blocking the rest of the dispensers. All test ok.=5d88cd37-702f-4ee3-901f-f109c335131b =836e2603-4d1b-4021-b9a8-1785c7391391 T14.75-15.25 31miles=43a88b55-a090-4764-b371-d93b52f09b29 15.25-15.75=d4a58653-88e0-4870-9e4c-c83437c5da8c 15.75-16.25 20miles=0e494d34-f369-4824-b94d-dc32ae70bac9 221222-0109=154c3264-2658-45c1-8d82-65d0d6b5a48b Han Dee Hugo #203=52c92444-748a-4aee-ad5d-26ad7aeb7e6a 1707 S Fayetteville St=a8ba4e6e-bf66-4666-88f6-0c3f91a52083 Asheboro=8fca9c41-cb6f-4e85-ba0d-1bbe52b4ce5b PO - 63707=14d45d81-7410-448a-bc8f-365a715ad960 =b8f511d3-51ff-4fa5-9645-7fea4cb981f9 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.
