All the CR were down when I arrived, after troubleshooting I found their wireless receiver had no power. Once I restored power to the receiver all CR except for FP 1 came online. I replaced the FCB on FP 1. Activated the FCB and downloaded TLS certs RKL and updated software. Afterwards I had to reboot the commander to bring FP 1 online. I tested EMV card transaction. FP 7&8 needed a PCN board replacement. I installed a PCN board, re-installed then old board, upgraded door node software for both sides. The dispenser lost calibration even though the procedure was followed. I had to calibrate all grades on this dispenser. FP 15&16 was previously repaired but 15 was bagged. On inspection the pulsers were tampered for both sides of dispenser. I shut off power to the dispenser informed the manager of findings and ordered a pulser set. All test ok.=0d9084f0-d45e-43f8-851c-d6c52fff7477 =8c38ff10-9a21-462c-9af1-ab8602d9c68f 03830673=7cff5aab-097d-4e2f-8e2f-3dec07546b3b 22741252=34e5be6a-f807-47d0-89c8-0458080a9597 =40e33d63-9176-42a3-bab0-f775226e6c32 =c9426fb0-8aed-4655-9337-021d4bddd435 =1fc59fd1-a32c-42d9-9768-7cf98a53dc2f =273bb9d9-cf35-40eb-abfd-1939e33c3f56 =7a88b211-3d26-488f-abf4-1ed6e03c5fb8 =8d64fc0c-ccc2-49e0-9898-03b533a69af8 =6e680db1-ce03-4cd1-bbbd-832ad75899da =dd551f44-7b74-482e-a60f-4c4d06a90842 =ccc22c5b-0f29-4a61-b05c-3e8122b6d0b4 =2197f5eb-4f7e-4660-afa1-e265b3b2f9c8 =01de758e-f97e-41f7-9233-136ca1614f24
