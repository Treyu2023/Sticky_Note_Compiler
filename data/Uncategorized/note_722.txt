Arrived on-site and found that the OWL techs had picked up their prover without checking calibration.=8d599799-c351-4511-95fe-d8d89b85a2f3 2. Previous night: Attempted to resolve DEF calibration issues on lane 17 by swapping pulser cables and changing the pump type in CC90, not knowing the OWL techs would leave without performing tests. Lane 17 DEF is still inoperable due to the Dual DEF Unit Kit installed and the pump type configuration having 3 total products (Truck (A side), Auto Diesel (B side), and A&B side DEF), with several variations in the manual adding to the confusion.=759a897e-e69b-4caf-89f5-3fe56b9bdb86 3. Coordinated with electricians to integrate the vent fan with the tank monitor, configured and enabled the device, and provided instructions for installation.=f5fe31c8-9e90-4621-bdfe-71ae7aa20e07 4. Resolved mystery cables in the ATG with Pre Fab Cabinet electrical schematics and electricians.=86b9dd1a-fb8d-481a-8f9e-8cede0d3889d 5. Identified that IPC (Slave 2 of 3) REG T2 MAGVFC is showing a constant SC (Short Circuit) error and needs replacement.=46944b3c-ec98-4b93-b048-8dd6699faf3a 6. Installed PIP board in FP 9, but the screen shows rainbow artifacting; need a MOLEX ribbon cable for the OMNIA 5.7" screen configuration.=22791319-c354-44fa-b7f3-672ef534d33a 7. Spoke with Jason about the MOLEX ribbon cable, which is on the parts hold shelf.=b66d3ec3-e946-4b3c-b605-d5030269b897 8. Sealed all dispensers with lead wire seals except for 17/18 (M/M) and 19 due to recalibration needs.=7f5a0c15-dccc-4efd-a678-0024ee58f32f 9. Discussed the handle issue on FP 19 and DEF line blockage theory with another fuel tech and the GC.=be63fd94-ac4c-449b-a99a-1e6aa0f6e303 10. Closed all MAG VFC and ATG covers to finalize work as much as possible.=8e4bde5f-d914-428c-b1da-ec4bd827c11a 11.

This must be done before other remaining tasks on FP9, including software upgrade and personalities upload, as well as CRIND configuration.=1f8d8ca8-b232-4b7a-92af-078fad3208d3 5. **Handle switch issue on FP 19**: Being looked into by QT tech tomorrow.=cafed792-fc56-4601-a555-7ab6f796e268 6. **Troubleshoot and resolve DEF line blockage/recirculation bypass**: Possibly causing the rattling sound emanating from lane 20/21 DEF cabinet sump.=6dbb5aa9-c8fe-4c92-a80b-f79381d9b01c 7. **Follow-up with QT contact Seth**: Determine if parts are required for repairs after they have had time to look at each issue before we head back.=084846b6-6770-40de-ab5e-3a0f97cb320a =816adc5d-10b5-49ff-8f2c-7e3c1e227199 Ongoing Project Summary=56b461f8-0af9-4d35-9cb1-477cec23380a =23d521c6-fbbe-43c9-a60d-fe2fa65430b0 Completed several critical tasks, including hardware installations, configuration updates, and troubleshooting efforts. Lane 17/18 remains inoperable due to the Model NPA - Dual DEF Unit adder cabinet Kit installed and dual line/product Hi-Flo pump type configuration, which led to confusion while troubleshooting grade 2 (DEF) side B Pulser functionality (remains INOP). The installation manual did not clearly indicate which instruction set to follow due to uncertainty about the pump type setting. Several options fit the NPA model without clarity. Will call TAC for clarification on return.=8e4b99e2-ed07-498f-9b94-f4bbb303e7fe =6af1c59f-a17f-4a02-a6f6-89a7691be054 Remaining tasks include calibration of DEF lines after the flow rate issue is addressed, replacing known faulty components (MAG VFC and MOLEX FLAT FLEX CABLE), and resolving a potential DEF line blockage/cold weather recirculation. The site is prepared for QT tester operations, focusing on ATG sensor operability and line/tank tests. All immediate actions were documented, and follow-up tasks have been outlined and communicated to QT representatives to ensure understanding among work crews.
