However, the alarm had been cleared upon my arrival, only to be triggered again during my inspection.=3924e91e-6445-480a-ad33-c4cebaeb5690 Moisture Assessment: Noticing signs of wetness on the sensor, I used rags tied to the pull string to check for water accumulation within the sensor track. The rags did not accumulate any water, suggesting that the observed moisture was likely due to condensation.=c110c826-20f8-438f-8a52-badd577a62fe Actions Taken:=787fe12d-4f99-433f-8fc5-f48d86b1b6e7 =4ff24ecb-82d9-44ce-b2d4-e21925ac438c Historical Review: A review of the site history indicated that a previous technician, GH (Roe), had successfully installed a new sensor and cable.=b0e0fd26-4b59-45ca-b985-22252dd929d1 Sensor Reinstallation and Monitoring: After reinserting the sensor and clearing the alarms, I monitored the system to ensure the alarm did not reoccur.=9710b3bd-7cdd-4a3e-b326-9c4772c51446 Conclusion:=253e1bc5-d6ed-4c0d-9d46-2ca64ec2664d The alarm issue with the L:2 Premium Interstitial sensor was thoroughly investigated and addressed.
