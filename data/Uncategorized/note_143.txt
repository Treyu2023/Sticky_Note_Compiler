The site was having an issue with Accessing accounting information on the passport to be able to print reports. I reached out to office and explained the situation which is hard to deal with without the SMR passwords. I contacted MCcon and had office reach out to 711. Without the SMR we can not proceed without taking drastic measures. Will return when we can find out more information about SMR and/or Administrative password for printing reports.

On speaking to site Attendant he had me looking in the back for the hoses. After some time I found both the hoses on the fuel islands. I was able to reconnect them. Test them and watched customers fuel on both positions. All test ok.=439887aa-abe1-4207-abc9-06a812aa2459 =8c4c98a1-65fa-4120-8651-e83074fa1cfc =a1548033-e455-4e4b-adbe-3d6dfbf3831d =382eb422-66b9-41b4-9c63-37fb2cbb8515 =77c8d6c9-9f20-4189-987a-dc0d1b703eb7 =f6e2eef2-772d-444c-80d5-20d70dff6226 =5c2c336a-2a74-466a-8455-d44d030f32eb =f7d8a280-4093-4f50-b274-47248769d0fe =9c6a4ea7-bc21-4cce-ae73-3b3ea440b0de =f5e53e41-e8fa-4e4b-93df-97605ae3b20a =e8004f2f-3eca-4d85-89a1-d77af0da528a =ccb23d0e-b520-4c7e-900b-62956d7c2a4c =f4ea7e83-0b12-497e-9a6b-5c0649b6d248
