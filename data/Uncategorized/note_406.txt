I rebooted the Dex, and both juniper modem both juniper modum and router. All dispensers were showing you in the status but the open pump register function wouldn't clear. I contacted decks and they performed a clean boot on the decks. Afterwards the rep stated they were all showing online on his end but no change on both registers. We power cycled both registers one at a time and this restored them to a normal state. I'll test OK.=localId_2c97b2eb6bea4894a6e0cd4422113418 =localId_6c6bc2aaea704f8a8763cd0dffe1b120 13.25-13.75=localId_12ba53776c714c5d991b2d3a02482c51 13.75-14.5=localId_718b3f4800f54a77a78cf89d1a171c7b 134715=localId_dc1c37a11db84571a15ee27878a14235 FWKD3592097=localId_5492f8048e5540128687a776bdd336f3 =localId_a26c197ed9e4484197c4b2d6def7c864 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. I couldn't access the equipment to troubleshoot after testing dispenser because the electrical room is full of clutter making it hazardously inaccessible and violating fire codes. Will need addressed before service can be performed.=localId_32e9a2f316b24131bbe697b556b3382d =localId_bb707f3c26e14d0a84dd941fb0d85c7c =localId_dd8000a9918849d0b97a605ec4ed365d 14.5-15.25=localId_92ef200d363d47fabd11e73d96212c7b 15.25-16.25=localId_3faf8369561043248dd632870edeb429 16.25-17.25=localId_3e6a128085c54a8ab089070bd4ae522c 134720=localId_1d26a04fb30e4fa9804043e04a4fa6e6 FWKD3592977=localId_6fc02f685d3a429d89cb5fa3ccf8d942 =localId_231bdf951d5747b589fcf93fa520b891 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.
