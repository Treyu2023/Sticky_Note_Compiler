The site has RUBY2 registers and have a small horizontal dead spot that affects their cash button on Register 2. I was able to make minor key adjustment on the screen for this register with the Managers assistance we relocated the MOP CASH key where it is not afected by the dead spot. I also cleaned the screen lenses and explained proper maintenance procedures to the manager.

I ran two tests both times it dropped 1PSI per second till it seated around 10PSI. I checked under a few of the dispensers since they were recently installed then I checked ther STP sump and found about 10 inches of Diesel coming out of the secondary piping. I then went back to look at the other dispensers and 15/16 has about 12 inches of fuel in it. I shutoff the shear valve and ran another test from ATG after this passed fine I opened the rest of the dispensers. The unionunder 15/16 had a pin hole on the seat portion I replaced gthe UNION and replaced the 5 inch section of pipe with a 2 a 3 and a coupling of 1.5" black pipe. I then tested for leaks.
