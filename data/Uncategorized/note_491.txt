The manager described symptoms of an E-Stop, the Manager doesn't think someone is hitting the E-Stops. To try to rule out wiring issues I started by disabling the E-Stop at the front counter. I notified the Manager of this and clearly labeled this switch was not operational. We will have to wait to see if this wiring is bad, or we will have to cycle the other switches until we can determine which one has a fault. I am incompleting this call for now. Before leaving a customer used dispenser 13 where the whip hose was leaking. I replaced and tested the whip hose. The installation of the hanging hardware is not properly done at this site. Several dispensers including FP13 are missing the two plane swivel at the nozzle. This makes the hose not rotate to releive twisting. This for the most part is only an inconvenience, but in the event there is a drive off where the breakaway is severed by a car, this can lead to more severe damage like we saw here. All test ok.=localId_d8f196fb7ef34fcf9ab61fce67f9b26a =localId_0eb4f3f9daee4450a1e52daeca8e6a70 =localId_241567b6782f4c4c8dbbe7bb97677f06 12.5-14.5 Duncanville return keys=localId_f69ad1f1bd884c9fb6fd4ed49dfd01bb 14.5-15=localId_3d96d8e750504469b376571b78575c3e 15-16.5=localId_a3545f3af0fd4d0d9b6569d145e1e20f 16.5-18 end=localId_39e64557b66d48b2877075c53fe8405d 139082=localId_ca6897d04b34415d92b41180ec3e7cd0 211230001=localId_a38170bb3dbc49dc8d344bfc035e7b79 Racetrac=localId_113d2c6b36b948a3a9efea6162b41084 100 Ovilla Rd=localId_24909acd97164e058fd5b35369458e5f Red Oak=localId_6ca14a018f9c467eb0ec9cf9cb553b85 =localId_32b3243ea547454e9884d01134ba0a6a Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. I checked all dispensers for signs of tampering. Some of the lower doors did have scratches on the. Consistent with someone trying to gain entry. No tampering was detected inside the dispensers though. I returned the key to the manager. All test ok.
