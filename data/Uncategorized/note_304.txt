I spoke with the manager and explained the scope of work. I noted that FP6 was offline at CRIND and FP1 had a bag on it when I arrived. I completed the upgrade of the CI and two Topaz 410 units.  I rebooted FP 6 during upgrade because the PIP3 had red lights on it. This restored FP6 state and once the CI was up both FP 6 and FP 1 are now working. I tested card transactions inside and out. The cash drawer on register two was not openning. After troubleshooting and rebooting the register the CD was working as intended. The system lost its registration during the upgrade so I had to re-register the site. I had to customize the fuel panels to make the new screens work for the customer. All test ok.=90a35ac1-d88e-4c25-b15d-77add6c9e9f8 =ba89265c-5e4d-403f-9cb3-6936345e0fc3 =7b36fa6c-5e82-4890-bdf7-64f432ee3a8c =84f96de3-ace1-426f-8cad-39e9568e1a68 VSID - 2497796=81bb233c-7293-48a5-980b-30a0049e0659 merchant ID exxonmobil - 659406=3167dfd9-8d65-41ce-b3d8-f0331b4022ed 2720864=4841c625-278d-4804-a85d-f27cc3b2c30f =e106937e-de74-47c8-a5f7-ef5a213b8ebb =0f031b7a-9b1b-4163-9649-e38087f4446e =36375b0b-28a5-4eaf-83d2-9867160d3b4b =d68cbc4c-8ebb-4961-8303-a7670ccc5da9 =03fc6b5f-ea8c-4694-a3d0-65b3e43b79c9 greensborodispatch@guardianfueltech.com=52b655bc-ea45-490d-835b-379907895105 gft123
