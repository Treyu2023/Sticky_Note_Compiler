ATG Showed several failures on the premium line 3.0 test. each showed running pressures normal but the check valve seating pressures were 0 psi. I opened the check valve and cleaned it as well as replaced the o-rings on the manual pressure releif screw. Every time I dispensed or ran test from the ATG I could not duplicate any issue.

However, FP#6N was not working correctly.  I purged the CRIND on 6, after loading I tested again without issue this time.  All test ok.
