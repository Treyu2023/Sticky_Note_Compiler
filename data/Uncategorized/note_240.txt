The breakaway on FP5 was faulty stopping the flow of fuel. I replaced & tested the breakaway. The manager pointed out a CR03 error on FP4 card reader and asked that I look into it. CR03 = tamper. I replaced and activated the card reader on FP4.

FP # 1-4 were offline due to Wayne door security. I was able to re-enable door security which brought FP 1-4 back online. The site is experiencing issues with their Wincor. I was able to reboot the Wincor and Cybera equipment in the server rack located in the store room. Afterwards the network and fuel were working properly. We had to cash out a transaction that originated from a card at the dispensers because it got stuck and could not process. This is likely due to the Wincor (Shell card processing device). It is my recommendation that the Wincor be replaced should these issues persist. This site has the older style of wincor running windows XP.
