Both of the diesel dispensers had been broken into. 24 was rigged to steal Diesel. FP1 was rigged to steal Premium. I shut off the breaker for the Diesel & notified the Manager of this. I asked that he not re-enable the lines until repairs are made and until theft prevention devices can be installed. Otherwise the repairs will quickly be undone. I worked on other ticket while I waited for MT who brought parts so repairs could be completed.=20e5ca04-aaae-47c7-b055-e462a63d4480 =f8f0018b-ae89-4d29-9bd6-d01287e4cdf1 After MT arrived we in staled the pulser parts in FP 23/24 and we also installed locks on these positions. We need to order and install the locks for 1/2 to remedy the Diesel theft at that position.=64604674-5d0c-4c85-abb1-c810ca4b572e =73c0e556-e5b3-4e29-941d-b3b769558577 12- 13 RTL=7acc6561-32ac-4312-af84-e4b1279ee346 =5f6cb02e-7b30-4751-a0d3-6133b34e0537 VMS - 132487=d403fad0-f8dd-446b-bb7e-6eec6ce71693 PO - 190665298=f57898e5-f3c2-429c-abef-c7a6252425c7 =9978c195-9203-4ed4-a7f2-a75bf6c0e231 (2 of 2) RT=b7493c6c-4197-4289-b66d-77f070c33ca5 309 W Spring ST=bd725c5f-9fd1-417d-a97f-dc0614d455e0 Plano=a283419f-6408-45ab-b51f-0413cf81bde6 =8ea28186-f4c2-4744-8f1a-f5164cfb8a17 Already on-site from previouse ticket. I investigated the 2W connections in the tampered dispenser (FP24)  for the affected 2W loop (#2). I opened and inspected the 2W connections in the BRCM  and ran the BRCM tool to check for weak signals. I couldn,t find anything I could say 100% was the issue. I did make minor corrections in FP 24 but again this wasn't a hard fault so only time can tell. I m onitored these fueling positions for a bit while I waited for parts another tech was bringing for previouse ticket. All test ok.=726072f6-3e4d-4659-8de5-14eb38ed416c =f6f28811-a063-4c8e-ac0e-877f40192460 =ad3a8826-6b8f-4580-a0a0-d3cabc1d555f =7a2bc21a-5300-4d11-a066-890ffa365f17 14.75-15.25=localId_cae47d37a0dc4f5b89104efdd1690dbd 15.25-16.75=localId_4d1999925f344dfd978c77abb9b172a6 =localId_b20032efcf6545a288f8b532e7050109 VMS 132510=localId_e84f201dd70a4b38b616524e78b0123b PO 62235573=localId_f61a29b5870348f283e9945e7eeceb11 =localId_2a2b9de954e443029d1e3dcdf6911375 MURPHY 8722=localId_69f151b738004ae3a1154120f77c64e3 601 S Angel PKWY=localId_a68dcd769d1a4f8a8beab60bd084480f Allen/Lucas=localId_da12d1b8ee074a1591f461db9b07101a =localId_da8d6edd186f4215a86d87306ab5d5ea Arrived on-site, checked in on Verisae and with MOD.  I attempted reassigning I IP. CR was solid yellow/Amber light like a card was in it. I attempted cleaning it with UX300 tool. I dismounted CR with power on per troubleshooting guide. I then attempted activation and ip assignment again. Nothing worked lights stayed powered off on IP assignment.
