FP #12 was displaying a CR 02 on the CRIND. I was able to re-assign an IP to the card reader, dismounted and re-activate it. Afterwards I was able to test a card successfully. I had to avtivate the CR from laptop because I could not read the screen. (can not put in work leads with my apps configuration both 11 and 12 screens need to be replaced due to sun spots 10.7" color). Dispenser 10 was also bagged. I tested it and found the premium was giving 5047 Ec (reverse flow detected) on Premium so I rebooted the dispenser and dispensed mid grade to orient the pulsers. this corrected the problem with FP 10. also cleared a paper jam on FP 10 printer. All test ok.=05128118-5aa3-4f43-a5a0-51494d21ddf8 =6dcaf8a5-753f-4a7f-9173-e83b5f0785b9 12.5-13 18 miles=c88e9aca-48a9-43b4-9b0b-24a0cb21e917 13-16=25004b8d-ea03-4cf4-98aa-881f26b3bcf4 230203-0338=9dacded1-ecce-47ab-a3dc-5f3553c6a0b1 PO - FWKD5205884=7691b7c0-9e2e-45c5-a085-cf6e3f1ea293 711 #35580=e0ffe2f0-02f6-4030-a656-40508e48fb78 7511 Pineville-Matthews Rd=40a3d92b-1ee9-4a99-b7d9-f8a3bac9ff18 Charlotte=06444cbd-1918-4831-9a7a-85a3d510cce9 =64cafac3-62e4-4257-816c-0e3142c7a7df Arrived on-site, checked in with MOd. The veeder root was showing D:8 auto dial failure alarm. I traced the cable and tested it. They have a lantronix TCP/IP card installed in slot 3 associated with this alarm. I contacted 711 NOC and got the IP address of the card. I downloaded the lantronix device installer and followed the guide checking the configuration. I went through the TLS setup and verified everything was correct. After troubleshooting I found that the alarm is pertaining to LMS reporting to GVR. The setup was configured to not actually send anything (all reports were turned off). The alarm history shows issues going back to 2020. After reviewing the ticket again I realizedd that the site called this in because the alarm on the screen, not cause they cant access remotely or perform normal functions. I disabled the device to clear the alarm and then re-enabled it and scheduled it for a past date to circumvent the alarm returning.

FP 10 needs a 10.4" display kit with bracket part of the bracket is missing and the lense is held in place with drywall screws only on the corners. this is not weatherproof and it looks like someone hit and bent the screen. The FCB may be faulty aswell, should bring one just incase. I replaced the whip hose and 9' hose on FP 6 due to dry rotting it was leaking badly. FP 4 the PPU board was very corroded causing the 44 error code. I removed the PPU and cleaned off the corrosion, the pins on the board are falling apart and this can not be repaired it must also be replaced. will return with parts, placing call as incomplete.=885872fe-74ec-4196-ba53-5227c696df58 =b096f09a-754c-4b32-8e20-6d91a58f62ef FCB - M11930K001=eaf4b437-5c27-4feb-bb6e-b52940eb3352 Screen with bracket needed - M142620K001=2bea9573-a542-4a5b-8908-8179f852f6de PPU board - M05838A001=eaa71b0d-8c0f-4468-a392-061d0249d25c =5257f7e3-b285-4ac7-a4e8-143928c36b77 =cbd2be98-d069-492a-88d9-19089599ee14 =6c24bcb8-8029-40be-b444-208e34c12659 =8591a9a7-1450-425a-b725-75f56b9d1780 =d4500e3b-e830-473c-87af-386ce3ae07fa =4af33ee4-3d81-4470-89a7-1e31c3073b21
