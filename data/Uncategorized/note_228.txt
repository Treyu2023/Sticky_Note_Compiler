I checked the cable and the adapters were verified by Gilbarco TAC. We moved the port to 6 and moved it back to 5. I had TAC apply QF18 which was for Car Wash Speed key settings. Nothing worked. GVR Tac stated that our only other viable option was to clean image the EDH. The customer does not wish to do this at this time, he is going to try to repplace the controller first. All work complete at this time.=984e5ea6-9622-4abf-9ac2-610a94cf6b84 =d39789e7-3e4e-4206-bafa-c94e2354ab5a =33b8318d-c7a6-43f2-a234-ecc43647fd8f T12-15.25 rerouted=0ff5d9c8-cf50-41cd-b470-327ba2746abe T15.25-16=73f5c14e-ef09-435a-8d4c-5a3a7fc4fde8 221214-0121=3d51ddf0-546a-4d8b-8514-b16d47728fbb Why Not Country Store=855b331b-384d-4d80-b528-c94eb5a16802 4222 NC HWY 42=20e64964-e9e7-4b4f-83ec-f95b1b47dd68 Asheboro=4aaf8387-2277-48e6-98bc-7e279d8247b6 =c1320ee3-073b-4b41-bc9a-cdc4146f09e7 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The Regular was slow on all four fueling positions. I replaced the two regular filters. The regular tank is an AST standing on end with no ladder, I am unable to get a tank sample.
