After a while the owner showed up and I worked to get dispenser 5/6 working it was experiencing issues with a small leak under the pumping unit. I was able to get the leak stopped which improved fueling rate, but it was still slow. after trying many different things it was discovered that the belt was stretching and causing part of the issue. I replaced the belt and the flow rate was corrected. The inside PIN Pad on the trendar is not working, I can not work on this PIN Pad and Trendar would have to be contacted for service or replacement. All test ok.=1af945da-e158-4ebe-98d7-3b9ef361d38a =52c4cefc-ec2a-4595-b697-200f8b120c8e =f5d06db1-5520-4263-aea6-c5b76103db8b 5/6 slow=df4fcd5c-c608-4ecc-bf96-8a4c20d98c5a =b5c8cf83-fcf7-4025-ab9e-37c60a776711 pini pad inside not working =04217c61-7f93-4d8a-bb0c-3b7fbf40e4d9 =cb8a129d-5709-4b2a-9a13-b2092c9be4ea Debit on the pumps=a89eac39-0764-4160-a3e4-c40939ccf180 =0133a1d0-94bb-4bfc-bdd1-b5879a140d50 =1a6061a3-ef03-4b12-984a-b7382b626b74 swivel trendar=ee5bfd2e-e9de-4614-b211-48ad7f6a8285 =cbe2cb43-4415-4631-8447-b3328c5e6149 =6354d8cb-2dd2-4b12-b116-8e6f232f9bd5 16-17.5 =df099c83-1f50-45e5-b3ef-4c0962aa6cbc 17.5-18.5 50 miles=b18c541d-d708-4b27-9c66-a942e7f7f275 230404-0106=fc4cdc04-5662-4dda-bfa1-fbd595de4f13 Quik Chek #11=adb19cae-e55c-487b-b9c4-3f4ab256b0b0 103 S Main St Candor=b79dafc5-6996-4d2d-8c68-1dbf71f7aff5 =19f1e733-919f-4913-a902-9b262f0036d2 Trubleshot cards not working to network issue with cabling under the counter.=7ffaf5d0-a5f4-4ad8-8b16-44c794e175c2 =af7dc831-007a-4619-87fd-367d8633d2ca =6528cbd1-c2dc-41d0-9cc3-90c72e4d53c3 =337ea5c2-844a-48f4-95e2-cea052a524e4 =ab93ebdc-53bc-42c4-8ac9-3916063a2e1b
