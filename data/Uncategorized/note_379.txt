He explained that the printer has not worked since we installed the overfill alarm. I appologized for the inconvenience and promptly troubleshot and replaced the printer. One of the two printers was DOA and kept saying there was no paper even though this was not the case. I installed the second printer and tested several reports without issue. All test ok.=cd598e56-55c6-4de5-b388-d7ee6c1d3af7 =0a4aef57-8ad2-4f5b-8330-1edb60c8df9a Upon mine arrival at yon site, with the owner did I parley. They didst share their grievance, for the printer hath not wrought since the overfill alarm's installation. With heartfelt contrition did I apologize for this vexation and set upon the task of troubleshooting anon.=cfbb09eb-830b-4f80-b8fb-593b4746dd1b =d81eefcb-fd27-41da-b08a-696fcb0c1300 In the course of mine examination, it cameth to light that one of the two printers was, alas, dead upon arrival (DOA). Though laden with sheets, it did protest with false claims of an empty tray. The second printer I did install, and verily, I put it through its paces with divers reports. All tests did fare well, and the affliction was vanquished.
