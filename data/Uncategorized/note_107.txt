I closed the forecourt nd purged all of the CRINDs. I ran the BRCM tool from the back room and the Diagnostics tool which showed all devices were updated and the field wiring is not an issue. None of the breakers were labled so I Located the breakers for the dispensers while I had the forecourt shut down and clearly labled them in the Breaker panel. I contacted CIrcle K helpdesk and got them to transfer me to the Tech IT line. I had IT escalate the issue to level 2 and the rep I worked with cleared the files on the panther and reconfigured the site. Afeerwards all the CRINDs came back online and tested good.

FP2 was on a normal screen when I arrived. I tested a card and it hung on "One Moment Please" I rebooted the DEx and FP 2 only came up to CRIND BIOS. I rebooted the dispenser and it returned to a working state and I was able to testw a card succesfully. I looked at the settings in the OMNIA board and it was configured correctly. The software on the OMNIA was very old so I updated to the latest production release version (5.1). I cleared a pronter jam on FP 2 and notified the manager that the paper they are loading into the dispensers in not Walllace equivalent the manual calls for. This paper will work, but it will jam frequently and damage the printers eventually.

The manager Preston stated that after the storm is when they started seeing these issues. I took the liberty of rebooting all the Hi-flow dispensers and recommended when the site isnt as busy to reboot the rest from the breakers. I updated the OMNIA software in 17, 18 and FP 3/4 while I was in them working. The dispensers were all running very old software version 4.2 and I updated them to OMNIA software version (5.1). FP 3 was showing CR02 which cleared up on reboot. After rebooting each of the dispensers they were working as intended.
