I Spoke to the manager to find there was no issues currently. They had issues last night causing no card processing or fueling. I checked the ATG alarm and delivery history and didnt find anything. I then noticed of the two battery backups in the server rack one of them has a bad battery light on. I removed the battery and checked it. I spoke with the Manager and the DM over the phone and she requested that I replace the battery ba ckup. I rode to get one and returned to install it. Afterwards I had to repair the server rack shelf to not be supported by UPS's and rerouted power cables to not daisy chain them together.

I replaced the nozzle due to leak and I replaced the swivel as well because it was going to leak next due to the hose type and normal wear. Purged air from hose and checked for leaks.
