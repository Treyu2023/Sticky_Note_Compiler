I reprogrammed internal network to use 172.20.100.XX scheme to refresh IP config & ARP Tables. I rebooted EDH. I cold started and reprogrammed the PCN. I remade the wire and plug connections for the 2w circuit and removed the heater wiring altogether. Afterwards the CRINDs took a download. Card pay unavailable came up on the CRINDs. I rebooted the EDH again which caused 5/6 to re-dowload secure prompts. After this both 5/6 came up. I tested an EMV transaction on FP5. All test ok.=localId_1ae2c260b4bd4bb485fc301e3a5d90c4 =localId_ba0f757fb1aa4f59aac3bf3bbcf3464d 14.25-15=localId_312ddcb82cc049d6a007242f5fc9d6f9 15-16.25=localId_6fd29bafaed44f078656478666035bc2 136966=localId_451a2ec1f24940d5965a5d97ab6b333f FWKD4063833=localId_69fda0d4010349c7a438d0e578398ec8 711=localId_0a48c197e49f44b49525bc23803aae52 750 N Riverfront=localId_819901f621b149bfa8459b8dedc492a2 Dallas=localId_cbd4d41798a444cabcbf2c5e54d4d701 =localId_b3c72e0ef7c947ed94a847c272b19ebb Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.  FP#2 was not taking EMV. I purged the CRIND and rebooted the EDH. This corrected the issue. The Cybera had no activity on WAN1. I tracked and tested the cable back to dsl modem on the floor behind the desk which had the power removed. I reconnected power & restored activity on cybera. Modem flashing DSL and internet light is out. The cubera came up and switched to 4G backup. I explained this to the manager & told them to contact DSL ISP. Tested EMV Debit on FP 2. All test ok.
