My initial course of action involved running a comprehensive diagnostic check on the PIN Pad. The results of this analysis confirmed the operational status of the hardware, effectively ruling out any hardware-related issues.=510ab051-6ce1-46aa-8db5-42b9061447e6 =03ea327e-c6ae-4372-9fb1-8c87e4142959 Given the nature of the problems reported by the site, the symptoms appeared to align more closely with network-related issues. To address this, I executed a strategic reboot of the Ethernet Device Handler (EDH) and proceeded to run a series of targeted tests aimed at isolating potential network inconsistencies.=2fa6f728-01f3-4dce-adca-a9639977a262 =e357a100-2ad9-4390-917f-5782aac64f15 Following these actions, I reached out to the administrative team and submitted a request for a warranty-based service trip. This request was promptly approved, clearing the way for the next steps in the remediation process.=2adac5d7-d35e-4fad-8024-a70c7002eee8 =68541409-fcb5-4815-9e4f-f644ef83d0dc In conclusion, all tests conducted subsequent to these actions have yielded satisfactory results, confirming the stability and functionality of the system. Rest assured, we will continue to closely monitor the situation and carry out further corrective measures as necessary.=bad69cd2-ad83-478c-9af1-923d21eb8c57 =fc179077-4c2d-4325-92d6-42855fc4519e 11-11.75 40 miles=5e0b56da-32c4-46d0-aa1d-03d3599c1d30 11.75-12.25=3e20b66f-f07c-4f5e-8154-e1584e07a744 230508-0087=3358f74b-3999-4549-9f16-58001b05c4cb PO - 245077725=28c690a9-4cdb-4a9c-8095-1c2a21190fba =b22bf1a2-a5e9-46c0-a9ff-4486022726e2 Upon my arrival at the site, I endeavored to register my presence through both the Service Channel (SC) application and the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system over the phone. Unfortunately, the automated response from the system indicated that work order number 245077725 associated with Service Provider 271371 was not recognized as valid. Despite this, I proceeded to check in directly with the Manager on Duty (MOD).=5401d231-3fb6-48b1-9c5f-2387113e62b5 =5fa267e9-f5d3-4675-9d5b-00655fb58364 Following a detailed discussion with the manager, I have ascertained that there are no prevalent issues with the Passport register. The concerns reported by the site seem to stem largely from external equipment, rather than the register itself. Notably, the site is currently operating with a Wayne dispenser.=dbbd3613-7b5f-4219-bba0-4ab69d503058 =ad27e9f0-cda7-474d-8392-aaabb3abe31c The manager further informed me that SPATCO has already initiated the process of ordering Service Pump Modules (SPMs) for the dispensers in response to these concerns. Given this information and the current status of the Passport register, I am closing this ticket.=ca46635a-e7a4-4b2e-b49f-e26f49961eeb =fcf482eb-04b4-4c2f-b1bc-0b5a521efa37 However, I will remain available for further assistance if needed, and I am committed to ensuring a satisfactory resolution of all equipment-related concerns.=54bce2b5-ff2a-45cd-9e97-3a1d243c55ac =1bcd8853-8dc9-42ea-997e-19aed01364d5 12.25-13.25 (rerouted/lunch)=f80dec7f-dedd-489e-898a-026b545db356 230511-0350=6cfdeb67-65af-484f-8acb-4f48fbc7a23b Waughtown Grocery=1264a3b3-14da-4d97-8633-92886b6bab01 900 Waughtown ST=1633c4cf-9252-452a-92e7-854255f83e92 Wiston-Salem NC 27107=3f33135b-24f6-42fc-8704-592b1708440e =593161fa-9b15-4975-bdd0-02f42530366b 13.25-15.75  93 miles=d8141317-5180-4f4a-9a0f-33db0da6dffb 15.75-18=9bc4293c-b7eb-48bc-a152-460cce98ca3c 18-20 91 miles=5f81233b-d463-44e0-bf04-058236fef813 230510-0198=db7fb7bc-ab5f-488c-beda-1942ac0edb92 Genes Orange Market=4c0b0d1b-3284-41e5-8029-f6d679b44142 2037 Philpot Rd=92844c8f-ed2e-46aa-b5b6-81576445404f South Boston=ff520250-33a9-4da8-a15f-39465367d7e4 =79591de9-456c-40fc-bb80-c8237fb09984 Upon my arrival at the site, I immediately checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). Upon conducting an initial inspection, I discovered that the Ethernet cable on the C18 was mistakenly plugged into a serial port. I promptly corrected this misconfiguration.=fc599025-5953-48f6-82c5-ceb000b8d6c6 =53ed658f-1ab4-440a-8086-458914a7af4e Following this, I dedicated about 20 minutes to troubleshooting the card readers. However, I was subsequently informed that the card readers were intentionally kept offline due to an existing hardware issue.=e104f9f3-1760-438d-b567-a493007ed4eb =bcb7af72-ac64-4a03-bd26-7f5bc72ce6c8 In the course of further discussion with the site personnel, it came to light that they had not received any training on the Point of Sale (POS) system. As an immediate response, I assisted them in setting up their back-office laptop and guided them through the process of creating departments and performing screen edits. In addition to this hands-on training, I provided them with valuable resources for self-learning to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the POS system.=115084cc-d7e8-43ab-8780-578e4fe4452c =a416ba06-10ef-4991-ad3a-cf801e5ad386 Furthermore, to ensure a seamless support experience in the future, I procured a backup of the register. I also installed TeamViewer on their back office PC. This will enable remote access to their POS system when necessary, particularly after they have their Managed Network Service Provider (MNSP) or another switch installed. Please note that I had to retrieve my own equipment after the configuration process.=e41f088b-ff63-46ac-9e5d-c330b7b26762 =734a5490-1469-4223-b1f4-585a46006871 In conclusion, all conducted tests have yielded satisfactory results, indicating that the system is functioning as expected. Rest assured, we are committed to offering continued support as needed.=eb2d02af-3f01-4ecc-aca8-2bea007169e7 =92a399dc-526d-40fa-8546-f86a835f7e3c buypass 3.12.34=c08ea2d8-6205-47bf-bc99-472469b322bd =85029b3a-1fcc-41cd-9c21-b8391f674e24 =eff9c348-4c33-405f-8ea2-e16a8a798157 =0024c5ff-fa02-4a53-9618-fe441b71753f =385fc382-0c35-4d77-966c-1d4c54eae62a =eaa99e10-4cc9-4756-8f1c-5d2190ae39df =8f1e9fd8-6317-4fed-9246-d5c67e77694c =bb13ebe7-4fed-47e1-8609-4496c5fec7b7 =d89a64a4-0192-4406-a73d-bf0f2d4dc33a =a78c941f-4468-45fd-abf3-448bd5c7133f =9d8c3885-1b7d-4f6f-9ef7-03b93462b47e =12d13e25-a0fa-416b-b937-72fed8450c43 =cfb36e7f-eeba-42cf-8139-b9a5dee29930 =5c568f32-3b04-4aa6-8cef-377f8373e580 =46b6ee04-41fe-41ea-a6d8-616e29c089c1
