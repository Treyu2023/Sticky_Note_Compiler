I hooked up a monitor to the Controller, but the server was already online I contacted RTSS and they looked at it and confirmed all processes were running. I explained to him that the manager was stating that the server was doing this frequently like everyday during day close shift change. RTSS then explained that he would escalate it to NCR so they could scan the databases. I Removed a battery backup in the closet that was bad and advised the manager to replace it. I also removed a printer cable connection for remote monitoring that went between the bad backup and the server. Nothing power wise was plugged into the battery backup. I told the manager what SS had told me and I also made a suggestion that they try shifting the time of the store close at this location by 30 minutes to see if they avoid a watchdog reboot on a device that could be triggering this problem. All test ok.
