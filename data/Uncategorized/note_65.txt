The old scanner looked like it was in programming mode. I replaced it with the new scanner then tried ressetting devices from POS APP and then rebooted the All in one. Once it came back up I had the HD on the phone the rep worked with me to get the scan sheets for murphys. I programmed the scanner and worked with the rep to relocate the device to the other USB3.0 port and then we had to adjust the virtual port in the POS config to match the scanner setting in windows of port 5 change from virtual port 11.

The Q:2 Reg (Back Row) was in alarm "GLF". Running the test from the ATG c;eared this alarm.I printed Gross test results and could see a clear pattern of dates and times ofGLF shutdowns between different lines. The ramp rates showed that the lines never pressurized just like in a E-Stop triggered scenario.I dug a little deeper and started checking the E-Stop terminal strip wiring. I found that the wiring connected to EM-3 Terminal were loose and on touching the wires the E-Stop tripped immediately (They were already down). I repaired the forementioned terminations on EM -3 and from what I've seen I am quite confident that this has been the sites whole E-stop issue all along.=9c049fc0-bd8d-499c-a3be-696ac994a9d3 =8578d0c9-3c98-4d90-83cd-3f8fe379b2f7 =1caae6a8-84b5-4b9a-a315-1e39ebd224a8 =97144162-86f0-4438-bf4e-5717e30a7c7c16 - 17 OTT=33010c8d-b6be-48c3-a3f0-3c919e4a7abd17 - 18.25 OTL=2b8dff1d-06a4-47cd-80e8-227e6ae9b1e5=b91008af-71cd-4c4a-8bee-29f79abb7aaePO - 182224381=5b08536c-3588-4a9b-80db-5851666b4c41 =a2fe164b-b09a-4169-b33d-8d53cf58deefRT 2336=2aec53b2-0694-4d98-adec-739cdc997a7d10707 Ferguson Rd=e5b918c6-bd86-43c2-94ac-7d86e297f063Dallas=a0532138-b0fc-4b78-aa1a-962399f538f2 =954a13e1-83ef-42f3-977b-400a6c306ced Arrived on site and checked in with SC & MOD. Investigated issue focusing on the E-Stop Circuitry and found the terminals on the pre-fabricated electrical cabinet were all in good shape and not loose. Out of the 5 E-Stop switches the one on the left side of store looking at the door behind the ICE chest was hanging on by the wires the masonry anchors were not holding this box at all and the conduit adapter pertruding from the box has detached making for a decent sized opening in the back of the 4" 2-gang box. which is likely causing the E-stop issue with corroded contacts due to moisture. I pointed this out to the releif manager on duty John and we promptly took action to wheather proof it until repairs are made. I contacted dispatch with these findings and they got in touch with RT RSM, they are plannign on scheduling an electrician sub to make repairs. I was directed to close this ticket as complete.

Investigated issues to find the line tested good on first try. I ran the Gross test from ATG no less than 10 times without any indication of an issue. I then had the manager work with me to make sure all the front rown dispensers were sending handle signal to veeder root since the dispensers were installed not long ago. All this checked out. I then shifted focus to the STP area. I replaced the Type R check valve and the capacitor. they were both pretty old the capacitor had a date on it from 2015. The STP Sump as almost 2 feet of water in it and the bolts werte stripped out and ceasedup causing additional time to access the STP Components. The problem is intermittent in nature and I was never able to get a failure with any test.
