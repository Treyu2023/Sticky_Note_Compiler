The north E-dstop was missing its cover. I replaced it and the inner cover aswell. During this procedure I shorted the Estop by mistake. I was unable to reset by the switches at the counter or at the electrical cabinet. I troubleshot and found a Fuse blown on the CP circuit. I had to goto Home Depot to get a replacement fuse. Once I returned I restored power reset the controller then tested and placed dispensers back in service. I then used leftover parts to fill the missing blanks on the south relay box cover.

Ticket states that the site is unable to get EOD to pull and they suspec PC issues. I connected monitor and keyboard to the site controller to find it was stuck on BSOD. I took pictures of errors and rebooted the PC it came up to windows login. At first we were still showing server offline and when we tried to run a accounting report it threw an error "unable to process function". The manager had stated that he saw low memory error on Register 1 earlier so we rebooted this POS and tried again before contacting RTSS. By the time I got RTSS dialed into the site the server offline error message had cleared. Iniotially we were unable to pull report and it was giving  same error. After 10 minutes or so it finally let us run reports. This was likely due to the Reg processing stored data before it would let us perform any  secondary functions. All errors are cleared and equipment is working properly at this time.

The ICR's were all offline when I arrived. The the two standard registers were showing update pending so the manager and I performed the upgrade. We rebooted the 3 self checkout terminals and the controller for them aswell. The registers would pull up reports but could not print them stating server was offline. I hooked up a monitor to the site controller and it was sitting on the windows login screen. I contacted storew support and after 20 minutes I got disconnected. I reached out to them again and got a different rep who contacted NCR tech and had him call me. I spoke with Dan from NCR and worked to help him get into the site controller at 2:25AM. He stated there was still some processes to run before they were ready and that he would call me back. At 3:10AM He called and informed me he needed just a bit more time. After some time he called back and I stayed on the phone with him for hours off and on while we worked out specific issues one at a time. We were never able to get the price sign to communicate with the Site controller. I was cut loose at 7AM and cleared by both the first shift manager and NCR as theres nothing more I can do. Fuel and cards are operational and the only remaining issues are with the NCR back office system and the price sign. All cleared.
