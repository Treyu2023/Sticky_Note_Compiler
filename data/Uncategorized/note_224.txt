The client mentioned that the previous unit only functioned briefly after my departure. In response, I thoroughly reviewed the relevant manuals and followed the outlined instructions to install the software on the PIN Pad. However, during the installation process, I encountered security errors related to a missing file.=localId_e4aabb15280e446788d2d0cd251dd857 =localId_8cb3798bb69e46ff875097009b0d59ae I reached out to Verifone for assistance, but the initial representative provided little to no support. Instead of the requested configuration file for touchscreen calibration, I received an email containing step-by-step instructions for conducting touchscreen diagnostics. Consequently, I contacted Verifone once again.=localId_580ea439243e49a48e4ecb7440ec7dd6 =localId_9c479c2f48d0494b8d38a5cf8e830646 The second representative attentively noted the steps I had taken thus far and recommended reloading the prior software version (2.02.05) before upgrading to version 2.3.3. They also advised replacing the PIN Pad if the issue persisted. Following their guidance, I downloaded the necessary software and executed the recommended steps. After completing the process, we tested the signatures, and the PIN Pad functioned as expected. All tests were satisfactory.=localId_ec6e17762fef480fb6149b3ac43a801b =localId_b6513e792c7f471bbc88ea9301dc164d =465fd05e-58c4-4cf4-ba03-37e7250d9184 14-15.5 60 miles=5fe3ce04-e8c4-43d2-8140-fcea08055b72 15.5-=fdc48211-a11e-4b6d-bbcd-d875cd2a0305 230413-0229=8d3c16a8-aa94-4a14-a2c3-ae0f88961617 PO - 242936992=2d205ea2-31b7-453b-a829-2e3d463977d1 Great Stops 11=c83b1989-d6ab-4eba-bc12-4bd8c3934865 1100 Summit Ave=1440e4b7-c64b-4607-89c6-e59b2b1d55b5 Greensboro=5917f295-20df-40da-a987-6b7444a6abc8 =36d506d5-ab1f-46cd-9b49-521c349540a1 Arrived on-site, checked in with SC and MOD.
