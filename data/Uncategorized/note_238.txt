Spoke with Manager. The CRINDS were very unstable, site running NEC registers for fuel in combination with DEX box. I tried contacting Dex no less than three times with no answer.I manually rebooted the Dex but the dispensers remained offline. I located the BRCM near the floor in storage area. The D-box portion had no power, the cable had been knocked loose. I plugged it back in and pulled slack out of the cable. I tested debit transaction at the pumps. All test ok. =localId_684122523d2a4e6d9568df94fcacd15e =localId_f8487d816ead467c830d2ca461f58e4b =localId_fdba09aad66f4e0985dcf3da0fc0f22d 10.5 - 11=localId_50945e398f4442f0882ab96069a394a2 11-12.25=localId_fbda9dc792d448188645880704d94a04 =localId_1da2f0a3892a45c489a5443e9885eff7 VMS 132535=localId_abf3179e2d0d40edbce1ceba2894cd06 PO FWKD3193516=localId_5c1f4c3665cb4601b97864ecdd801eaa =localId_85c491654f0746fba9ad58a0d64c27b6 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.

I tried re-assigning the IP of CR on FP9. I dismounted the CR with power on to trigger the sensors. I then purged and reactivated FP9 CRIND. While coming back up the Passport and/or edh rebooted for no appearant reason. Once this completed and download completed all FP including FP 9 were displaying normal prompts. I tested debit on FP 9.

I was able to purge the CRIND on FP 8 to recover its state. On Testing I found that the nozzle latch spring was INOP. I asked the site if they had any equipment before replacing with parts from my truck.

No parts from FO8 were returned to the site. The site also does not have any equipment so I replaced the missing parts from FP 8 (breakaway,swivel,hose and nozzle with splash guard). I purged the air and tested for leaks. FP16 was bagged, but I ran a debit transaction and dispensed mid grade testing all products and was unable to reproduce any issues at this time.
