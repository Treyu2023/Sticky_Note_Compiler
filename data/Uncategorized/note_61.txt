The issue was with the RT rewards card that you tie to your debit account. U could make a purchase inside with one but when testing at the dispensers it would not read the card. I tested multiple fueling points and put one in diagnostics where I saw 0/3 tracks read. It's unclear what the exact issue is at this time but after speaking to RTSS-Systems they informed me that this is a company wide issue that is currently being worked on with no current fix eta. I informed the manager of my findings.
