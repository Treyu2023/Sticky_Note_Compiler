Initially, the contactless function on the MX915 was non-operational. After various troubleshooting steps, including rebooting the Commander and pulling fresh tables, the issue persisted. Decided to replace the Commander but kept the old memory, yielding the same results.=786a1d00-db1f-498b-832a-e1268f0e948b =3ff33081-50fa-46f4-853e-76dea66958a7 During a call with the MNSP (Echosat), discovered the site had been on backup internet for weeks. Traced and corrected cabling errors, linking the WAN port correctly. Even after these steps, the issue persisted.=d654c17c-e7e8-434d-a03a-ffccc3b270ed =3fa94f12-176c-4ed3-a304-c8c438e785d2 Finally, replaced the memory chips in the Commander, forcing a clean software reload. This resolved the issue, indicating the problem was with corrupted data in the old Commander. The absence of a current ASM agreement limited our troubleshooting resources with Verifone, prolonging the resolution. All card types are now working both inside and outside. All tests OK.=c34a4b6f-1551-4916-8a9e-2c3547272517 buypass Dianna 8/30/23 - no case numbers.=69db4f09-9781-4800-a67f-73c52df2d6fe =718c11bc-039c-4255-bee2-2e136a31b2e9 =7f301cf5-a5c2-46c5-865c-c0940a564f65 14162D0=c8927ece-73bd-47de-8539-dfb355a6b1e6 =230ca9b2-6d40-43c7-bf43-4292e39caba8 =224435b7-d809-4642-a072-1d44468c48b5 =39cf6ae6-fe59-46f1-a553-5d8373d1b27e
