I could not recoverthe CR so I replaced it. The replacement stayed in error and wouldn't activate. So I replaced it a second time producing the same results. I then ran M7 maintenance troubleshooting tool. This only showed error with the CR. I troubleshot a few things before upgrading the UPM software to the latest version 42.11.22 using the same EMV 3.09. Then I was able to activate and test the card reader. All test ok.=localId_73514fc8e14640c0b217d16b799d25d3 =localId_0a82619aef0e45dc8ef3fde9a048cb56 13.25-15.75=localId_70f51282c5ae448881969a426a3a8711 15.75-18.25=localId_e59c65d1dfc14cf5a6f643eae37d3b99 18.25-20 ottdh=localId_77e277fc4b96445f92792be47b7ca05a 136075=localId_56aff33e74b74c3eb8133221fcd2adee 64378812=localId_646d870dbabc402da71c75bb871a0609 Murphy Express 8716=localId_66daf9320f684cdfab25c9c7d9926ce9 1721 N Commerce St=localId_02020377706d462caa4f59456f64da1b Ardmore OK=localId_a01c799f124446cc90c7fda9876cdf52 =localId_1d1ff0b176c1420fa386e45d3b95cff1 Arrived on-site, checked in on Verisae and with MOD. I ran M7 diagnostics, but everything checked out. The Manager explained what seemed to me not to be the CR but the UPM suffering communication loss potentially locking up. I replaced the UPM. I RKL'd, downloaded TLS certificates, upgraded the software, programmed CRIND settings, purged the UPM, uploaded the Murphy Express personalities and activated the unit through the ASC app before contacting Myrphy HD and had them send their 3 downloads to the CRIND. Afterwards I tested EMV Debit. All test ok.
