FP1 was very slow, 2 was also slow but not as slow as 1. I replaced the breakaway on FP1 and after testing I replaced the 400-30 filter for 1/2. FP10 would time out after enter key was pressed following zip code entry. I purged the crind and tested successfully. Now its working as intended. There was no bag on 7 and it worked as it should when testing. All test ok. =localId_dae2bd27e1b440e598ffcc3373c3f6db =localId_c844d2ecd3c3448789d759a6ad38e2aa =localId_caccc7f241e8449db92e76a3220a1408 SS=localId_d341cd7d67ed4a65b25d4943d372f7b2 14-14.5=localId_3adb454577c94ca8a23825daabfac1b6 VMS 132678=localId_94245f0c3508480ab316c3a494910290 PO FWKD3217483=localId_cebf48015b964dec9cb8199d4810c41d Already on-site from previous ticket.
