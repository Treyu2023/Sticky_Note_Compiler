Initially, I found that all CRINDs were offline except for those at dispensers 3/4 and 15/16. A recent intervention had addressed a loose cable issue at the BRCM for channel 2, which affected dispensers 17-20. Despite restoring connectivity for these dispensers, a subsequent reboot failed to bring most CRINDs back online.=73b1b357-5eb2-4dc5-b6b1-7c36386b0e44 =88e2d126-afa7-4290-937d-005bd4e1f481 Investigation and Actions Taken:=25334ea4-04e0-48ab-b8ec-cc94f100206d =e70fdfff-9b04-4547-b16c-1004dffeeb8f BRCM Replacement: I met with a parts supplier to acquire a new BRCM, then returned to the site to install it. Despite this effort, the CRINDs remained offline following the reboot.=ecd1de71-2394-4d8e-93df-6a4cbf79309f Diagnostic Troubleshooting: After consulting with tech support and shifting connection ports on the switch (due to suspected damage from a previously shorted cable), there was still no improvement. Further troubleshooting involved isolating and sequentially powering each dispenser, which successfully brought each online.=1f48a7f0-4524-4673-ae4c-be0b923b9267 Resolution of Connectivity Issues: The diagnosis indicated a likely damaged cable and potentially compromised ports on the switch. Replacing the BRCM and utilizing previously unused switch ports appeared to resolve the hardware issues. However, persistent issues suggested additional complications with the Controller.=8978c674-27fb-48c1-af65-d4bc520b5776 Conclusion:=d4141cb5-bbe5-4bd4-bf99-52d0a8304541 The corrective measures taken, including the BRCM replacement and strategic adjustments to network hardware, restored functionality to the dispensers. Continuous monitoring post-intervention confirmed that the fueling operations were stable. The resolution suggests that while immediate hardware issues were addressed, ongoing vigilance for potential Controller-related problems is advisable to ensure sustained operation. All systems tested subsequently are now operational and meet expected performance standards.=c3fe256d-ec15-45b9-91f5-fdb9156e45dc =303a5ae3-1484-4363-8749-beb6c270a5a0 BRCM Serials=2b7f906b-d288-481a-b3bf-4140d9ed50de Installed - LESC129005=02f8e9f7-f811-41d3-bbfd-058a0091169a Remove - KEH0014490=72faae37-89a2-4915-8e31-34f846f76691 =1ae31eca-a3cd-4114-9d10-e9394dad860f =bd5e1822-42e1-48f0-9f4a-c28280e2ba21 =b1a06d78-3b21-48a8-9896-d01c4d2d7848 =0ab0825e-bd1f-4561-8103-3b0e0707a05a =87ceab58-e624-4d1f-bf85-9a17623c2f23 =2dfd6953-c636-4f3b-8ea9-50db0a1a467b
