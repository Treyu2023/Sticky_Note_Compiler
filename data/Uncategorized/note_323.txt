I tested a card on FP4 successfully and spoke with the manager. Someone was here yesterday from Guardian and she could not say if they fixed 4 or not but it was bagged. She also stated that the auto shutoff was not working on FP 11 and the lower door was ajar on FP13. I found the upper door shield over the lower door and I corrected this on FP 13. FP 11 the Diesel nozzle had some debris inside the nozzle, I replaced the nozzle.

The site has FE Petro motors with MAG VFC controller. They are using mechanical leak detection. The flow rate was excellent when I arrived. I Explained to the manager what could cause this intermittent issue. He explained that this is happening every few days during different times of the day. I replaced the standard check valve on the REG STP. I checked that STP pre start was turned on and that the lamp test time was sufficient to accomodate site configuration in each dispenser. I made adjustments to the lamp test time on all positions to increase the time for the motor to pressurize the mechanical leak detector. From 3 seconds to 7 seconds.

I tested the CR's and found 5 and 6 dificult to insert cards. FP previously with CR02 error code had corrected itself. I confirmed with manager that both 5 and 6 have had complaints. I replaced the UX300 CR for both 5 and 6. Activated and tested the card readers.
