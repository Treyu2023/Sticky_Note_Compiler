Subsequently, I conducted a test on the replacement pulser. However, as the issue remained unresolved, I proceeded to install the IS barrier board that was located within the dispenser. Regrettably, this course of action failed to rectify the issue. Thus, the next recommended course of action would be to replace the power regulator board, specifically the T18994-G1 model. Consequently, I shall proceed to obtain the necessary parts and have placed a call on parts hold.=200e0861-6a09-46e7-a915-fc926138d8d5 =6a6bc510-2caf-4171-8120-4d10edc56ebb 10.75-11.75 25 miles=5769ede9-c5df-4522-868d-87d8957470b9 11.75-12.5=60d9a359-caef-4d55-bef6-5aa7a3e68859 PO - 22865115=b4ecaf63-41c1-4373-b349-ca15747c06a5 Tony's Citgo=d2cb2a7c-b6ec-4926-9602-5073afc072e0 3300 Edgefield Rd=a3b59cca-b9d4-42ad-ada5-02a00ca7f43a Greensboro=2c0a7229-0aae-40f1-adb1-cc49fab5f723 =6922d439-8f14-4aa5-98fd-42c6d6bc3b80 Upon arriving on-site, I proceeded to check in with the MOD. However, I was informed that the owner was not available on-site but I did have a conversation with them over the phone. Through the network functions and reports, I attempted to provide them with the desired outcome. Unfortunately, we were unable to validate the outcome due to the unavailability of an old report on-site. Hence, I have provided the site personnel with comprehensive instructions on how to replicate this particular type of report. I can confirm that all tests were executed satisfactorily.=5bfe2292-f2fb-4b52-9a52-7f11fbedbeb1 =cc937308-702f-4da8-945e-c0a68d0f7ca0 12.5-13.25 30 miles=dc676509-5ecb-4d40-a158-a0a5f249ba46 13.25-16=cd3c262d-ef56-43fa-9537-05f527da2c6a 16-17 50 miles (Home)=048413c5-5551-4f60-b5fe-59fd582e436a 230406-0301=450be1ca-e19b-4500-b86c-a45968dc5b28 Handee Hugos #212=5957a268-f0ad-4164-a725-416804723022 2829 Randleman Rd=fc950226-b987-4ec9-b9ec-47cdb3751419 Greensboro=bd5ea845-8e65-417c-825f-c3c31372b695 =1e4a13ca-b094-49c4-a80f-8228d941de9d Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The ATG was showing test aborted for Line 1 Regular and REG PLLD out as well. I opened and inspected the hole and found the sump was dry, but due to the depth and the rain I had to wait for a second man before I could breach the sump. Once CM arrived we worked together to install a replacement DPLLD sensor on the Regular STP and tested it from the ATG. We openned the foresourt and monitored fueling operations for a short time. All test ok.=245b21ce-6abd-47e4-a8ac-d7429a2fe8de =c9f041a6-2911-4ff2-855f-e780a15a85ac 17-17.5 26 miles=2d63a99a-984a-4182-94ba-a66e77f34034 17.5-18.5=94b10801-8b96-4642-887f-03360f165c14 18.5-19.5 35 miles=fb12afb1-eb8e-46dd-a390-357f08227fb8 230407-0253=03ad26fd-9387-4f18-90fa-5c49288bd739 Mars Food Mart=a10aa611-0141-4ddb-8af1-43174cb4a41b 1114 South Main St=4dbea90e-e92d-433b-b527-9716223b7755 Randleman=6674c876-5b56-477d-87f2-e4e158dbe6f4 =4d724642-e5aa-44a1-9987-eca99aa4a7c5 WEB-002630261=6d34ea45-1ecf-4abc-9071-702a7f9c1236 =11f358d7-7575-4fdd-8171-5dc017164f7b Upon arrival at the site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). I identified that the PIN Pad was experiencing a known issue, as indicated by the Config User1 access error. Consequently, I opened a case with Verifone (Case# 08702285) for service ID 1872336, informing them about the situation.=beea5f06-6fa4-462a-99ca-2646f3ce9e09 =20f4d57d-4938-4168-873a-8ea1244f0824 To resolve the issue, I proceeded to swap the affected MX915 (Serial# 262-440-374) with a replacement card reader (Serial# 804-970-611). Subsequently, I installed the necessary software and requested an expedited encryption key, which I promptly installed upon receipt.=d3f9404f-42ea-4bd9-bcd5-ace3aed941e8 =ab80c762-c0c9-4987-9af2-30cca6c2216d Finally, I conducted a series of tests on the new card reader, including EMV debit and credit transactions, both contact and contactless methods. I am pleased to report that all tests were successful, and the device is now fully operational.=2d21d411-eaf0-4973-989f-9642ff0a4470 =e2737ac3-abb3-43bb-822d-5e3844d8d64f =c5581453-cc77-4988-b77d-1ed240414826 =635c0542-94d9-40f2-a102-f6f484d9c10b =a8b56857-7360-4691-b65e-1ea9e5d67ded =f4a51c44-0e84-4680-bf95-12b3f54925e8 =083ec7d8-ba75-405f-a5d0-5328d63c3fbc =5ea52db4-522c-433c-8116-042bc701abaf =8364003c-47c3-4797-8d91-57c8d199ab8a =cccc161d-589f-41b8-a7cc-8b442dbc17af =7e4e79d5-c417-4dd8-8aec-f4174514f7c8 =7ab93819-cdbb-4715-99e0-afbc8aa31424
