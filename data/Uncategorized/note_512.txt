I then suggested that in his email he have the site reboot the BRCM and network equipment over the weekend. It's unclear if that ever happened. I then configured the CRINDs and Pumps (23/24) to think they were FP 21/22 and they came up instantly to the normal prompt. This told me there is nothing wrong with configuration and/or equipment from the Pump/CRIND side of things. I contacted RTSS and had them open another ticket with NCR because the one from friday was closed. I worked with the rep explaining this and we rebooted all of the network equipment. after we still could not get it up I contacted NOC and RTSS again to see if there were any changes. After a bit of troubleshooting while waiting for NCR to call me back again I discovered that the IP's were still set to 21 and 22 IP's For some reason it did not save or refresh until I reconnected to this dispenser after checking another one. Once I made this change they came up and worked normally as if the network reboot fixed issue. I tested card transaction.
