The PIN Pad on Register 3 was already working by the time I arrived. I traced out and tested continuity of the cable. Register 3 PIN Pad was in tamper state, nothing could be done with this. I contacted RTSS and requested a PIN Pad shipment to the site. All test ok. I was told that a new ticket for installation would be put in, closing ticket.

I tested EMV Debit on fp 20 successfully. The manager stated that previously this position had a CR error on the display. FPs 3,4,9,10,11 and 12 were all bagged aswell. FP10 had a CR02 error, I reassigned the ip for the ux300 and purged the crind. The issue persisted. I did get 9,11,12,3 and 20 all working which only leaves 10 Card reader replacement and 4 NCR stuck sale issue. I confirmed with dispatch that there's not already a ticket for the CR on 10 before placing order on this ticket. FP3 Was giving "pin error 4r" whenever debit card was used at the dispenser. I deleted VLU plugin and reloaded the UPM software. I then downloaded tls certs purged the CRIND and rebooted the tiger Box. This corrected the issue on 3.
