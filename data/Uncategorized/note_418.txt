I was not even able to ping the IP for FP#16 UPM so I replaced the UPM. I upgraded the software to both sides FP15/16 to 42.11.47 UPM Software for security reasons, because it looked like someone may have actually tampered the device. I was unable to get the UX300 to take an IP I tried to activate just the UPM and tried to let the unit come all the way up to update secure devices state but never could get communication. I then replaced the UX300 and I was still unable to get it to set an IP for the OMNIA to see it. I troubleshot following the manual again and eventually figured out that the ethernet Port for the UX300 on FP 16 was also bad. I changed the port to the spare and it came up immediately. I was then able to update secure devicES. At this point I contacted GVR and performed RKL and TLS procedure. I was unable to get my laptop to actually complete this on my end because of a Java issue i think. I kept getting Proxy errors when tring to initiate the M7 tool. I re-installed Java paying close attention to the settings and rebooted the PC before it finally worked ( I think I spent an hour just messing with this)=d6b021dd-c325-4dcb-8aec-946dafaeaacc After the RKL and TLS Certs I got the CRIND to a state where the Panther needed to be reset. I then went to install the CR out of this dispenser on FP 8 because it was going to need the panther reset aswell once complete. After completing the ticket for FP 8 I noticed FP 16 was not working still. I reviewed the settings and in 3 minutes found that I had set single auth where none should have been selected due to NCR registers. Then FP16 came up without another reboot to the panther, I was able to test EMV transaction seccessfully except for the printer cause it was out of paper.

Ran tests from the ATG and noticed the presssure fluctuated between 11 and 14 PSI with no rym or reason to the motor running which is causing the Gross line fail alarms although it is not affecting fueling as the ATG is not controlling the line. I then barricaded the DSLSTP SUMP and openned it to find the hole is very deep and the transducer is laying at the bottom. There was a mechanical installed at the STP. I contacted Ron to get a second person for Confined space entry. I also had him try to find out who may have installeed this mechanical and why. We came up empty handed and he sent Jake out to meet me so I waited for him to get close before bagging off all of the Diesel. I spoke with the manager in the meantime and shut down half of the diesel dispensers to help flow issues cause the mechanical keeps tripping. Found out this was because they did not bypass the ATG when installing the mechanical. I think Tanknology did this work. Once Jake arrived we installed and tested the new transducer . All test ok. Placed Diesel dispensers back in service. =93ba7c08-b067-48e6-a37e-70ce4ff8bd73 =adce540d-ce19-4df0-af44-5c067a6038ad 1PM - 2PM RTT=36340b24-c1c3-4edf-ae22-d7e2bfa370ef 2PM -  330PM RTL=4a2648a2-1332-44bb-bfac-21264fd4d02e=a862277c-d2c5-4961-8a09-ac4ceba3ff18VMS - 130047 =670b0044-1dee-4819-9bcc-0191ca608c43PO - 179608071=0ec6cd43-844f-4d87-ac44-847a87c9ff28 =abc5a408-c413-468b-a6c3-2a34ec2d91e5RT 2515=6c41f3b0-e982-421e-a508-6cb288749ecc121 N Saginaw =6f7f69a8-3cd9-4b9b-8806-ccfa6dea7d7f =2d68dca1-aafa-4bd3-a47b-1a5e47a864e4 Arrived on site and checked in with MOD and SC.

Nothing outside was marked or bagged off. The MAG VFC and VR ATG were not showing any alarms for premium. The last 3 Errors logged in the MAG VFC were SU,OC and SU. These issues are unrecoverable in nature and should they be accurate that would mean that the MAG VFC would hav ebeen replaced circumventing me being able to pull these codes in the first place. One thing that can cause exactly these error codes is the setting on the MAG VFC for motor size being wrong. I checked and changed the setting of the motor from 4HPVS to 2HPVS. The VR was not showing any logged error conditions to coroborate this information. I spoke with Micheal again and asked that he elaborate. It turns out he tested two dispensers 14 and 16 and each of them gave him an error code in the PPU. He failed to retain said codes and/or location other than just in the PPU's. I pulled logs from 14 and had to reference the manual since these are NJ6 blenders with 5 products to determine which product pulser 6 was. Dispenser 16 showed the same error on the same pulser before pulling logs I was able to replicate the issue which was that the reverse flow error code was on the same grade selected. additionally the volume display registered 0.00 on testing and this told me that it was a pulser orientation issue. I reset both dispensers and ran mid grade on them. I explained this to Micheal and showed him what to look for and how to correct this themselves in the future. This problem can occur after any power loss if the line pressure is a little low for the premium the check valves are not designed to hold offset pressure and allow bleed through the relief valve causing revers flow during orientation calibration.

The Veeder root showed Variouse alarms for Q1 and Q2 stating basically that it could not see the DPLLD Transducers. The problem with this is that on the status page I was getting readings (possibly static) I checked to see if the PLLDs went through a low voltage disconnect but found the belding runs being intrinsically safe went straight to the trough feeding the ATG. I then rebooted the ATG and both DPLLD's returned to normal status. Reviewing the Alarm History showed the first signs of trouble on 6_2 just after 815PM and this was just for one of the two lines the other didnt start having trouble until some time this afternoon but both became progressively worse as time went on until they stopped communicating altogther today. I explained to Sam the manager what to do should he see this again but also if it continues to still notify store support so they are aware of the problem and its frequency.=5944bbf0-70ac-40aa-a1ec-7c1053791c14 =6da268e4-7dd4-4bc6-b85b-7079e5685e6aSadie said my fluke meter is in her top drawer=6f57f97d-e900-4618-8719-ac7be891ce74=e0af5ea1-554c-46da-8ae4-6faa2b6698016/4/21 Friday=58d44548-8ea9-4c61-8cda-c7179489e646 =8d024a20-d26d-4cca-96cf-fc20d7ee2447 =5666d4cd-06d9-441e-9228-1bfe9359a1af 1130AM - 1PM Shop=12fc3f1d-ebec-4ed7-a7d1-e69f545310a0 =e7a2c541-8b8a-429f-a5c3-9b3af06c97871PM - 2PM RTT=e8299578-9b7c-46d3-8455-f037f136152e2PM -  5PM RTL=e0b2a59a-a8b5-431d-bb9d-90af0e03a58e=d12e477b-0ef4-4927-a09d-0e9b48674921VMS - 129886=98e17fe5-48d0-434d-a4d0-468eedb8e575PO - 178218628=c483a94e-202f-48f3-8aca-a7456d6d652a =a93c33c3-87cd-4bbf-8a24-941ea12581f1RT650=d13ff727-5a2a-4b0c-9010-53b2b4cdf73e1703 South Loop 288=b5a5826c-2494-4ecf-b498-2dd833644a98 =288bfdc5-7088-4f24-8bb7-19809e24477b Arrived on site and checked in with SC & MOD. I started by unplugging both printers and both single line displays and checked the cables real good for damage. I ohmed each power circuit to ground to rule out a dead short. I replaced the Crind reg bd. Powered on and it blew the 59V fuse. I realized I did not unplug the power from the displays but the data instead so I unplugged the display power and the power cables feeding the CRIND logic boards. and replaced the fuse. I checked voltages coming from the power supply and leaving the crind reg board per the manual and they all checked out. I plugged up one CRIND logic and it blew the fuse again. I replaced that CRIND logic board and powered it back up. I then plugged back in each device one at a time powering down each time to do so . I restored power to all devices and was able to cold start then test dispensing.

No bags on any of the dispensers when I arrived. I checked the ATG and the MAG VFC and there weren't any errors. People were dispensing 87. I spoke with the manager about the issue to find that they had the dispensers go offline earlier. The manager here now was told by her manager to reboot the dispensers and fueling equipment VIA the E-stop. Which corrected the offline issue but by not bagging the dispensers they had customers fueling before all the equipment was ready which caused PLLD shutdowns. I advised against doing it this way in the future and explained a few ways she could have accomplished this without having these problems. Fortunately the VR ATG had re-tested the lines likely after a customer finished trying to get fuel which re-enabled them as long as no one tried to pump regular again while the test was running.=66bb7e5a-2e45-4b2c-8bd5-a6016f889c43 =b852159c-ce09-4091-855d-4ee6672dd746 =4032bb9c-cb19-4ed5-b3a7-37b821ed8691 =a9594187-e195-4b6c-81c6-7a086be94ce06/5/21 Saturday=e4bc5ccf-6913-47e6-8c88-75448085ed33=03cd499f-85a0-4cc7-9f2b-2280186d0b231215PM - 115PM OTT=afc8140c-16ea-4f56-a312-5621f41bbc75 115PM - 230 PMOTL=9c15e03c-0d25-4f23-8926-8dc56b84190d230 - 330 PM OTTDH=0cc3aade-2b5d-43e7-8ef2-60b95020df82=aaa9a1a7-2c1f-4a35-b107-37283a9fec3dVMS - 130100=484c8782-7d35-404b-a51c-a9fc332ec204PO - 179844605=bc3a24e4-5aae-4ea6-81aa-0cc7f5b3d586 =7d398aa4-840b-40e7-8f25-bd70d0f06bfeRT 215=521eda50-15f7-4342-a4a1-7aec0e64d2c24870 W University Dr=5175b21d-4449-4c89-8602-85273ee88261Prosper=11399e94-1eed-41e0-a766-f9323a354dc7 =34bbdc2b-02fc-491d-8f74-5925d1306932 Arrived on site and checked in with MOD but was unable to check in to SC due to the ticket being closed last trip. I checked the programming on FP 11/12. I found that the blend is programmed correctly, in addition to that the other day I did not connect laptop, instead I went through the programming on 11/12. Then I compared "Just the blends" with two other positions by means of just hitting enter and checking the PPUs. I didnt even go into programming on 13/14 or 3/4. The reason I mention this is because I found that the Zmodem cable was unplugged from PCN. I am unsure if the logs John is referencing are static information or if its logs he pulled from the day that him and David were out here in which case they were calibrating and to calibrate one of these grades I am pretty sure they have to be set to 0 or 100. Its possible the WRU report could have been taken during this procedure. I  pulled who are you, Event and Meter logs which I sent to John.Howell@Gilbarco.

I first rebooted the ATG and this allowed me to clear the alarms and restore fueling operations. I found that the ATG had many more alarms active then it did Thursday night. It looked like the probelem was getting worse. I found a printout showing this same alarms pretty much and it was dated for 8/19/20.  I ensured I had printed all the device information incase a module and/or the ATG became unrecoverable. The Bay door chart was not filled out so I filled it out to be able to easilty cross reference their physical locations. On doing so I discovered the B1:S4:6 (Channel Type Relay) was programmed as overfill alarm but there were no wires connected to this slot. And B1:S4:11 (Channel Type External Input) had a 12AWG Black and a 12AWG Brown wire connected but no where in the programming could I find this channel populated. I tried tracing thewires through the Prefabbed Cabinet I made it to where the low voltage disconnects for the dispensers were locaed and I could not determine from there without cutting a bunch of zip ties and wire bundles loose. I stopped at this point and spoke with the manager to see if they had overfilled the tanks when this issue occured. He stated that they did get two deliveries but could not say if the tank was overfilled or not. I went out to the overfill alarm and noticed it was flashing in alarm outside. I tried the reset but it did not stop the light going off outside. I opened the overfill alarm box to find a 12AWG black and Brown wire connected here. Armed with this information I moved the wires from the the external input channel to the Relay channel programmed for the Overfill alarm. I tested the output relay and stopped the test. I went outside and the light was gone. I dont understand why a system setup data warning did not occur but I do believe that the overfill alarm coming into the external input channel is exactly what has been causing this issue. Closing ticket.

We went over what he had already checked and then worked together to resolve the issue.

(Tanknology was already here doing a annual for the site) The L10 sensor is position sensitive and was raised from the bottom of the sump. Placing it back on the bottom cleared the alarm. TAS removed roughly 120gallons of PCW from e85,diesel STP, Premium STP and both Regular STP sumps. The L1 interstitial high liquid alarm on the annular space for Regular tank is due to a bad sensor, with the sensor laying on the ground and the float almost allthe way to the bottom it was still reading High liquid. Ordering a replacement sensor for this position.

One thing I did notice is that all the alarms are on the same I/O module in the Veeder Root B1:S3. There are two I/O modules the second being installed in B1:S4. The module installed in slot 4 only has the E-85 external input(10), E85 control relay (6) and the overfill alarm (7) relay. I swapped these two modules to see if the problem will move with the module.

This did not clear the T:3 Probe out. I then took the probe inside and connected it with the cable attached. This also did not work.I re-installed the probe at the premium tank after cleaning the connection on the cable because it looked kind of dirty. This still did not work so I swapped the regular and premium probe without using the same connecting cable and the problem stayed on the premium tank ruling out pretty much everything but the Cable.

There are currently no issues with any of the Lines. ALl test ok. Additionally the ticket says that now the diesel lines are doing it too. Just to clarify the diesel lines have been going down this as well since atleast the 6th. Before leaving the site They did go down but now its only affecting one of the regular lines, 3 probes and several dispenser pan sensors. Also for the first time rebooting it did not bring the line back up it remains in alarm. Modules in the ATG are going to have to be replaced due to high interference. I spoke with dispatch we decided for now the best we can do is bag the front dispensers and let site run till we can discuss with RSM in the morning and get back out here with modules.=37e23f7c-a7c2-46f5-b470-569abb0160c7 =34d71837-cc92-4939-b3c3-bcfbc1571abe6/9/21 Wednesday=4d3db01f-3e57-4536-a310-d8c9da4c4326 =18b0ffc5-05d4-4a16-aaeb-c3c4d51da400730 - 8 AM RTT =70bc4a8e-5e49-45f8-bd5c-d9361e0060878AM - 930AM Shop=67dba2ad-4316-47c6-b12c-6b744de4e054=c370a609-7e3a-428c-8e64-b568f8659817 contacted VR and had them ship USM modules for RT 2477.=a1e4875d-dde4-49eb-a8c5-22d4ad39fea5 =5bbeade6-d12d-4e1a-89a8-f1bb494361c4930AM - 1015 RTT=5c216b3f-9be4-4a83-b20f-88d88afcd3911015 - 12PM RTL=997a72bb-9ec8-49f4-8a38-0267e8a0ec39=93f59129-4096-493d-9afb-18b8846f84d2VMS - 130206=2fd8ad10-3c50-4163-8c1f-aeb96f9f6500PO - 180202375=e4478fb8-00ad-4857-9924-e9947fa6dc00 =38762b8c-9562-4d6e-b6e5-772858d221dbRT 2429=0b660bb3-e487-4ae4-8202-c3f70a95ced53510 Carbon Rd Irving=acd93172-4cc7-4e63-8d20-14220e56f8fd =735de799-7c72-4e63-b99e-cdd70a4f82a4 Arrived on site and checked the E-stop boxes outside to see if any looked like they had been tampered with.

I investigated the issue to find the reg Probe is in alarm on the Veeder root. I checked out at the tank pad to find that an epoxy pack was just installed on it. I puled the probe up till I could disconnect the cable going to it and cleaned the connection real good with rubbing alcohol. I gave this a minute to dry and then went back inside to see the alarm has gone away.

Investigated issue to find the Q4 Regular back row line was running at 17PSI and quickly dropped to 10PSI before it would auto abort each test I ran. The other regular line was dispensing at 26 PSI. I closed the ball valve and ran the test again to ensure the drop in pressure is at the STP and not in the line. The pressure drop continued with the ball valve closed. I replaced the Type-R check valve, no change I pulled the bleed valve and replaced the o-rings this made the pressure a little better but still would not pass 3.0. I then changed the pressure transducer and this corrected the issue.
