Upon my arrival, dispenser 12 displayed a "Please Pay Inside" message. Given the high site traffic initially, I took the steps to purge the CRIND (Card Reader IN Dispenser) and reboot the dispenser. After these actions, the CRIND was stuck on the BIOS screen. It wasn't until a complete Commander reboot that the CRIND successfully loaded and resumed normal operation.=0a1cd320-8bf7-442e-a060-7b2f7ed9c443 =b946890e-a8d8-4db7-ad31-e783dc64ef47 While attempting to assess the flow rate of dispenser 12, I encountered an additional challenge due to the site's above-ground tank setup and the Ultra-Hi grade Diesel in dispenser 12. I had to wait approximately 30 minutes for a customer to utilize the dispenser before I could adequately gauge the flow rate. From my observation, the flow rate appeared to be functioning well. All tests were satisfactory.=d4150da8-8ca4-411f-a2ae-9bdf7aa59e3e =761e9bcc-fed4-4ba4-822d-3ca9fe54362b All work is complete as of this time.=fdf5637a-1aa0-4523-b3ff-cbcf26091ca7 =c57781e5-10be-473c-b385-72e1567bae34 =26b87001-de00-4220-88fe-1afc265a5d3e =49cf8b24-fcce-4aca-97ba-3f744890bf91 =db514878-b77f-4431-b6c2-e755b7937263 =c8cc77bf-9fcb-408a-984d-1cd6a5a2b8ad =8aac5565-923d-4d62-be16-fc7e761d92c6 =6b286cda-24b4-4100-9e61-ca75ff9624d7
