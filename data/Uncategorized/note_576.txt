After Fernando left I continued to try to get 1 online with the Passport. I had to reprogram the IP addresses and configured mutual authentication. FP#4 lost activation while I was here as well. I was able to re-activate FP#4. After correcting the issues I found with the FCB on FP#1 I still am unable to get this dispenser online. Placing in incomplete. I think there is a POS issue at fault here getting some weird errors on the passport. Will return to investigate POS issue.=f2e7627b-3450-41c9-b35f-339baf2630d5 =79186386-8af5-467f-9b79-d3c4ddc90052 16.25-16.75=e0575a3d-20d1-4495-9812-46faf5aeaebe 16.75- 73 miles=9cdd2858-fe70-4f10-824a-d7950ed17c0a 230127-0225=84c19f1b-2f93-4168-b1b2-1a99f91000cc PO - 1-5495703392=9b52eadf-4c9a-472b-ace0-8a66b3ba03ae 711 #36064=196a5f62-e370-4f5c-b38d-3094ab82436b 713 S Main St=5a4be6a5-e4a3-4b18-8ae8-91c9aec36b74 King=c0409a3d-c84d-414e-92b9-d3bae09b819e =a661d8a3-f33e-47f4-9f5a-9eac2008ebb1 Already on-site, FP#12 was leaking Diesel.

FP 11 was leaking at the filter, the filter was barely hand tight. FP 13 the nozzle was broken. I replaced the nozzle on 13 and tightened the filter on FP 11. The manager showed me paperwork where Crompco was here yesterday idk if they had anything to do with the filter on 11. All test ok.
