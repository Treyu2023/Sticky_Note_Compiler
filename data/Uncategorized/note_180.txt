Examining the event logs for dispensers 3&4, an error was observed but only occasionally for Side A of FP 4, roughly every two weeks. Given the infrequency of this error, determining a specific cause was challenging. After discussing with TAC, we agreed on swapping the valve driver board between dispensers 1/2 & 3/4. This would allow us to determine if the issue reoccurs due to the board itself (if the error appears on 1/2) or if it’s related to the pulser or PCN (if it reappears on 4). Dispenser 3/4's serial number is EN00250475. All systems were tested and are currently operating correctly.=07601b9f-a6dd-4eb3-9014-88d99818b83f =7e0d9ba8-96ca-4033-bc98-3e7701729125 12.75-14 35 miles=9597acc1-118a-4bed-838f-f7a45439fe7d 14-15.5=27b21b55-1951-4135-aa08-c637a2b4b7bd DH 15.5-16.5 61 miles=14c5690a-bd17-4dbc-b84b-417e290331d8 230821-0260=e3ca0a65-3089-4c03-8b2f-56028276eba0 PO - 68178506=161ed24b-752b-4e08-a4dd-f34409ba2f50 Murphy 7242=e137f590-0648-484a-abb3-1792aa0cbd8b 1403 N Scales St=bdd6c7e7-8fc0-4834-8620-aca5e5b847bd Reidsville NC, 27320=484302ff-a590-4137-9087-d1f1328b3dbe =0918dada-0aa8-4ef8-80dc-4b5df9d97f58 Upon arrival, I completed the standard check-in protocols with the MOD and also logged in via the Verisae APP. I proceeded to test dispenser 9/10 (serial number: EN00060019) in a standalone mode. My testing was thorough, including multiple transactions for each grade, with a special focus on the Premium grade. A static test was also conducted for meter check valves for each of the straight grades.=d94e957b-53c0-495d-abc6-38b54328a4a0 =56acc145-57df-49b4-ad25-9ef2026ff29d Despite these tests, I could not replicate the reported issue, specifically with the Premium grade. I accessed the dispenser logs, hoping for insights, but didn’t discover any errors that might explain the reported problem (the only errors I could find were from the 27th and 21st of July both times our last two techs were onsite changing hardware and working on this dispenser so I would say this is normal). A thorough check was conducted on the pulsers and meter, ensuring there were no signs of tampering.=c0ed621c-0d39-472c-b0a7-9ee333cd20cc =c73626d9-d83c-46ca-a023-41f10b9b5a54 Given the lack of evidence or observable issues, I briefed the manager about my findings, emphasizing the need for close monitoring of this particular fuel point. The objective would be to detect any peculiar behaviors that might provide more detailed insight into the problem. As of my last tests, all systems were operational and no anomalies were detected.=6fe24f48-f238-457c-a481-8de766214907 =6f2249dc-e605-440a-b3f7-ac52b74046a0 =68dc5030-d50d-47af-9ca1-0ffb54d7d95a =92645676-2adc-498a-8822-e4936ea63888 =deeadc86-86b8-41d0-bc05-77823e98ceb5 =0b74d512-5f73-4aae-ae0b-5ff5004e759d =dfa0f2f1-6284-4473-8902-182a5ae7b46a =8eda527c-1b79-445e-91f5-f73c1e7096c2 =e98219ee-b50c-4c32-8641-3fff04cd6472 =f41c0836-8dfa-4989-a0f5-72c9db9fe2ad
