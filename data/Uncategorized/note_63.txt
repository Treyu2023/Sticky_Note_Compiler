I replaced the tampered UPM. Activated both sides. Upgraded software and downloaded RKL and TLS certs as well as programmed the CRIND on FP9. (45 min on hold phone call for download from GVR) FP9 was still showing busy on the register. I ran normal procedures, rebooted the EDH and performed a close day to try and correct. The problem. I cold started the dispenser. And programmed it. Nothing cleared the state on the passport. I will have to return and have GVR dial into the passport to see if they can assist. Incompleting call for now.=localId_4224b554c8ad46c1b89d506d1991ac81
