Once I arrived I connected to the Applause server and verified the settings. I was able to synce with the server through the sites network. The password and IP are correct according to the Sheets manual. After a few phone calls I found that yesterday the password was not working and somehow it was corrected before I arrived. Its unclear who exactly was here yesterday, but I think they were sheetz guys. Before leaving the IT department called me back and asked that I look at FP 10 and 14 which were not displaying applause when tested yesterday. We turned on the dispensers and rebooted the fuel controller to get the CRINDs online. Once we did I tested both 10 and 14 and both played commercials. All test ok.=8fc7aa04-d312-4f24-99b1-2bd061968e16 =7ae5fea6-82b1-4b41-8b8e-244cdea891af 11.25-12 43 miles=ec9580f7-51b0-4b32-a01e-f3f959022a28 12-14=27ef4b57-c3ed-454f-b577-b39ccfe9a27f 230216-0064=1b8b21e7-9ebe-4920-882a-8cb6fd8add6e PO - 22224466=06cd7997-226d-4778-ab18-a2ff0ae6bfdd Sandy Ridge Exxon=f95a7365-1dee-4e7c-8a84-39dbf009d1cc 3205 Sandy Ridge Rd=622e5cd7-1ae0-4801-899e-f78d46017dc8 Colfax=be5eead8-30f6-4c51-bf9e-edf0fdac20c8 =0eb4164c-4f02-4b32-a5b3-0461cd4ccd4e Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. It was dispensers 5 and 8 that were bagged. Both looked normal when I arrived. I tested mid grade on both fueling positions without any issues. I discussed with the site possible scenarios that can cause CRINDs to lock up. I ran the BRCM tool and found that all 6 devices needed to be updated. I went over some other causes and pulled logs from FP 5. No recent r=trends or error codes would explain the issues they were having. The cashier showed me two drive offs that she says were card authorizations at the pump but after the issue they became cash transactions she had to treat them as cash drive offs. This could be caused by the BRCM/SSoM issue. She also stated that customers were complaining about the nozzle on PF #5. I replaced the nozzle and the hose because they were very worn the hose's outter lining was deteriorating. All test ok. =f2f216f4-5ffe-44cf-8d3b-1a8627b89b69 =5fbbb135-796e-44d0-a15d-10d24bfa1da1 14-15.25 45 miles=6b2b301f-a4dc-4bca-a020-8813e873ab90 15.25-17.75=26cb8325-390f-402b-b936-c4889e4bc64e 17.75-16.75 55 miles=620ba2f0-5d78-48a5-84ad-fffe847993f6 230216-0274=51f6a3a4-908e-4161-9c61-df002dc4b557 Han Dee Hugos=f138e9e3-e2d0-465b-9b99-d72f11a164bb 1701 Cotton Grove Rd=e44d5e71-dea2-40cd-aec9-2efef560058f Lexington=ab522c91-514a-4390-8852-963fb17676f9 =063c98e1-f661-41c5-8041-b1619a10e3fc Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I investigated the issue to find that I could not get the relay to test properly so I moved R:2 wires and programming to R:3. After I could not get this to work I tested R:1 and it too would not work. I  thought this was odd since R:1 was working when I got here. After some troubleshooting I found that neither the tanks or the lines were programmed for manifold and as such the manifolded alternating relay will not test or function properly. Once I corrected the tank programming for manifolded lines on T:1 and T:2 everything started working as it should. I contacted James Midgette per ticket notes and explained the issue to him. On his request I went a step further and verified the motors/relays do swap automatically when I raise the probe to trick T:2 into low product forcing it to switch automatically back to T:1.
