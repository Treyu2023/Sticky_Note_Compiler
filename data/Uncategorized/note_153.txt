FP#1 was powered off. When powered on it was just flashing all status LEDs and toggling the STP's every 3 to 5 seconds. I am assuming this is the original board. I replaced the PCN and downgraded the software. I upgraded teh Door nodes and upgraded the PCN to latest software and pulled configuration from door nodes. All test ok.=localId_c73fd4a42bef4184bc17adfb823f36c3 =localId_fa0122baa9b94dee81b085c9e3d65695 =localId_c0b02fd58f77494a80b256d0edca4b1f =localId_fa165dde268743fc819bc171e3c057f2
