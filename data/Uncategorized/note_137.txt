The site had experienced a power outage, resulting in various issues. According to the manager, while most card readers had been restored to functionality, readers 1 and 4 were still facing intermittent gate lock issues, hindering card insertion.=52509f6e-bd87-48c7-93b3-fdc47bd7a956 =0fc10dd0-1424-48cd-96eb-5f27c933e282 Although replacement is the recommended solution for such issues, the site declined due to associated costs. To aid in future incident management, I guided the team through procedures to follow during power outages to minimize potential revenue loss and downtime. All systems that were accessible for testing performed satisfactorily.=6117b3b0-cabd-4401-8111-5f0a1425debf =78321ad4-28d1-4ebb-9d27-b75c369ec837 12.75-14.25 45 miles=e1bf1e86-9b7b-4df6-8a3d-72d7b0312ddf 14.25-15.25=cc966f17-46a6-495f-90cc-0df36684bf4c 1-5617680302=876286a8-0809-45da-bd32-04426e264ac7 230620-0179=d04b86f1-8db6-4d2a-8733-9eed1e12a29e 711# 36061=882ea268-3dde-4c10-baf9-033cfd3fc6fd 713 S Main St=c3ebc1dc-5d9b-4302-96ca-3998b38da42c King NC=054b2bd7-9ceb-4246-a15e-f1616bdfa464 =5f896d6f-44c5-4c4e-942c-be8dc8e4c483 Upon arrival, I checked in with the MOD and proceeded to address the reported issue involving grade selection on one of the site's 3+1 dispensers. This is a recognized issue, yet to my knowledge, no fix has been established, and the resolution will likely involve a software update when available.=9cf37b13-dcfd-4d7e-a859-1950a9d93371 =defe3bfb-8a88-46ce-a226-eefafb65bbb0 I clarified this situation to the site manager, demonstrating the problem: if a grade-restricted card is used, the system will not allow selection of restricted grades, a useful feature for specific customers like diesel truck companies. However, the current software occasionally carries this restriction over to the subsequent transaction, causing confusion for customers not requiring the +1 grade, in this case, diesel.=f3143a56-118a-4b8c-82da-e4293a1ff578 =2933d318-0d03-4fc1-ae6a-9cc55b61b0bf As a workaround, I advised conducting a dummy transaction by lifting the diesel nozzle after payment, selecting the grade, and allowing it to reset to zero. Post this, one can lift the gas nozzle and select any grade, which also resets the issue for subsequent transactions.=e2154ffa-4ad8-43b6-be24-b7a03be8564b =89b1f4aa-5512-40d3-af25-7057b015dc89 It is important to note that, at present, there's no permanent fix for this software bug.
