I explained the scope of work and estimated time of completion being 2-4 hours depending on the size of logs the upgrade will have to process. The manager made the descision to call the owner which I totally understand given the impact to their business. The manager eventually answered the phone and stated that he was not informed of this and declined the upgrade. Pulled off site. =9c2db29c-fcb3-432d-9d6f-2ec8787bf699 =520a9483-f54d-45f7-9118-9f47306b837a =60ec5246-839a-4a18-bfef-794bfbb54436 monday 8:30-6:30 10 hours=03206cc0-3082-4ff2-9e19-895769594cb0 Tuesday 9-7:15      10.25=10dd4f9b-577f-46e5-85a1-c87e7733c955 Wednesday 8:30-1:30 =c3d11357-a925-471f-905f-8cd3d048677c =8f40669c-deaf-41b0-9e5b-b6e77e2a896d =994e4d80-e7fe-4d47-82e9-c1ef0d2e2a8c =c70ef23f-4cb1-443c-8a15-8f67c607286b Manager=af259425-564a-40fc-97c7-a00d4b623e34 Admin123=ba260793-3b1c-4bfa-a232-089fd7b39ef3 =e10b968e-f12f-4386-9c89-9ac6d1c8c40d =df3cde60-5c51-4cc0-b401-2872289f8325 Good morning. I would like to express my concern regarding the recent situation at the dealer site. Despite explaining the scope of work, the manager and owner were unaware of the required upgrade, which is mandated by Exxon and carries a non-compliance penalty. Unfortunately, they declined the upgrade, which may not directly impact you, but it is a cause for concern. It is imperative that they are informed of these upgrades before our arrival. As you can understand, it is difficult for me to argue with their decisions, given the facts presented. The nature of this upgrade requires the dealer site to close their business for 2-4 hours, making it necessary to involve them in the planning process. This week, I have had to attend to these upgrades every day, which has been quite overwhelming. Last time this occurred on Monday, I was assigned to run calls in Charlotte for 10 hours a day. I have other responsibilities that require my attention, and I did not sign up for this type of work. I would appreciate it if more planning could be done to avoid similar situations in the future. It would be helpful if someone could reach out to these sites and explain the situation to avoid wasting time and resources. I believe that open communication and collaboration are key to avoiding these types of issues. Thank you for your attention to this matter.=58c1188c-9261-4512-9f19-baac65cca8b9 =4a86b36f-d7ad-4ddd-88bb-8c8f9fe2e87f My time is valuable, and it is important that it is utilized effectively. I hope that the necessary steps are taken to avoid similar situations in the future, and I appreciate your commitment to the work at hand. That being said I am going home. Im not running calls for charlotte and I am not driving all over NC today. =2f0b16ed-c1d7-4fd3-aa56-75ae71c63aee =8c104c6c-d57d-4da4-998e-b117ed21fcc0
