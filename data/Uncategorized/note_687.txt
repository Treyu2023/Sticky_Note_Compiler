Attempts to downgrade the software to previous versions resulted in errors, preventing any successful change.=15702368-ae41-46e4-8189-fb8b59c7cd7c Time Configuration: Configured the time settings manually by disabling the NTP server and setting the timezone and time directly on each of the UPM's.=7dc76596-7333-48c1-b5fd-072005e112ad Network Configuration and Escalation:=1bc7a383-2ba8-48ea-9bcc-becaa8d02767 =e2350338-87c1-46eb-9ea7-5d88b45d2129 Paysafe Coordination: Collaborated with a representative from Paysafe to ensure the URL and port requirements were correctly implemented into the network routing rules for the MNSP device.=53e5197d-6e7c-4264-b164-a33705d27356 Continued Issues and Tier Two Involvement: Despite initial adjustments, configuration issues persisted, prompting an escalation to Paysafe's tier two support. They assisted in refining the rules, which eventually led to successful outcomes in the diagnostic tests.=066ab0e8-1353-4b1a-8929-5ea3ba5421f4 Registration Attempts and Server Issues:=87349c3c-ed30-489e-a458-efb04fc16f6d =bd031207-4226-42b1-86ef-b8285f079ed1 OMNIA Registration Challenges: Continued attempts to register the OMNIA were met with persistent errors. Following these challenges, I reached out to GVR TAC for further insights.=aa6442c3-2677-45db-a1a3-3cadfcf03378 Server Downtime Information: Chris Blair from GVR TAC informed me of an ongoing issue with the registration server, which was confirmed to be down for maintenance, with an expected resolution by the end of the day.=06ae5ea4-e144-4c74-930f-b160b02fb572 Conclusion and Next Steps:=fbca75d9-ec0a-429d-bec4-66b991f9fca0 =d6e1d95a-f23c-4453-b958-4338a539662d The registration issues are likely tied to the server downtime as reported by GVR TAC. Given the unresolved server status as of 3:45 PM, and the additional complication noted by Tristen from Paysafe/Echosat regarding URL format restrictions in the system setup, a return visit is recommended. This will ensure all system elements, including server connectivity, are functioning correctly without the current external limitations. A follow-up visit after server issues are resolved will help confirm the system's operational status and address any remaining configuration needs.=2f47c1a5-8543-4b86-8874-2812fdd083a4 =a94a88c8-6528-48c6-9f61-596622023523 The Customer must be required to allow access to atleast the following=7262e037-ac45-4e70-b8a7-bb6140d0934e ercsh.gilbarco.com (port25201)=e5b0df12-0f19-489b-bf17-3a34d6b37c9a erkl.gilbarco.com (port5001)=dfae2937-a0b7-4077-a718-ef9bf16c8d31 device.gilbarco.com (port 443)=83c1e59f-88b1-411e-9525-d0b34ce0f6cc registration.gilbarco.com (port 443)=0b1c0aac-266a-4d45-b0f7-473efde5b5b6 transfer.gilbarco.com (port 443)=c6a70045-916a-46fc-9976-44495459aaca =fcb7245c-ee75-412a-9a65-25f27b9810d4 =4617005c-8438-4b02-8245-b04be6668bf9 The AWS IoT URLs must be set up prior to software upgrades =a8a4b048-a2bb-4edf-92f9-974cabad504f and any attempt to register with Insite360 through AWS. =73ae936a-bf4c-44a7-8d1f-0be84bd66288 Ensure that network rules are done by the customer IT =5e1d9e52-fe4a-4888-917b-7c7fd6a0758b department or MNSP provider.
