I tested card transaction on FP # 2 and 4 (the only two bagged positions)  Both worked flawlessly. On speaking to manager again I was told FP # 11 would not allow card insertion. On testing CRIND, this was not the case. I was also told that 2 and 4 had unavailable on the screens. This may have been POS/NEC issue that had resolved itself. I'll test OK=localId_1cc9d9600abc48afab4b4e7d0262a9f4 =localId_b1bf4857072f4c109aa1a7ac4a135be5 15-15.75=localId_220ba6ed285f44e389363e0396c815f2 15.75 - 17.75=localId_4806528f93644d5bbd480acf2c7ac3b2 =localId_a92107c1363740638ab12c4fbcbcf2da RT=localId_12fdb219ece34b24be833045cf655fdb 7001 BOAT CLUB=localId_7ab12289e72042719b1ad974c2e9568a Ft Worth=localId_edc54c0cccf74957b96ee0c5d40f0f58 =localId_31fa6372fe2a4b8ead8985d1fac22097  Arrived on site, checked in on SC and with MOD. I shut all FP down and checked 2 wire connections in BRCM. I also changed the channels on the field wiring board. The BRCM and panther were fed from different power sources, so I move the BRCM plug to share battery backup with the panther Box. To rule out facing issue. I purged all 16 crimson and checked UPM fuel position settings I opened every dispenser and checked the 2 wire connections I found 2 positions that I had to remake the wire nut connections  After pulling on the wire nuts. I also pressed in the individual wires for the connections on the DCM omnia and PCN connectors additionally I missile line the pins on the 2 pin connectors for the omnia and PCN2 wire 2 pin connectors to better secure connections.
