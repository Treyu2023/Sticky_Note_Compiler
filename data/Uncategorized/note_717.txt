DIspenser was clearly indacative of the issue by the fact someone took the time to write a sign and stick it to the register stating to pay attention when fueling as dispenser will not shut off on its own. Initially I was unable to locate anyone with a card and the mechanics number on the ticket took me to a national automated center when called. I waited for a while to see if someone would fuel to test the nozzle before I rode to the front where the shop manager stated they may have a key or test card. the people at the front office were able to assist and get someone to the fueling facility with a truck to test dispensing of the fuel and shutoff mechanism. It tested good and I closed out the ticket. All test ok.=b9aad1f2-c243-425b-af02-87f8058e8801 =ad606401-52f0-4122-807e-67d88bc80750 brian letzon is checkout contact on-site,=f153b7f3-356e-41ef-a803-40214cbd4b5b 104157 check in code=6df396a8-2a65-487d-84b4-b4caacd5811c 120352Check out code=8699b8ee-4527-493f-9a0f-281e277e1ab7 Nozzle S/N'=4f78931c-314a-4929-b0a1-b7c435f8d93f in - 04062073230466=f3687e8b-a133-4c81-9220-21a891954392 out - 200714X0249=feae0c73-fee6-42ba-bf2c-3ee8cd0d04bf =103d46e2-2850-4ee5-b681-6cac638c7d8b =230164dd-9e86-4a23-9ccf-0d59e63d561d 14.5-15.5 50 miles=da8fd016-63e4-4405-8633-f8d7f54491bb 15.5-=97ea48cf-9180-4637-a5c7-d40d7b4ee78f CAP 0005=b84df12c-ca30-4540-b571-92a31cb3c46f 826 S Main St =09ed18c3-a083-4ba3-8ab0-ab0a550f94dc Kernersville NC, 27284=9fce8577-64a2-4661-b520-974520dade13 =2ad7a60d-3041-4277-9e2a-dde9da4a096a Arrived on-site, cheked in with the MOD. =7ab6e554-c43b-497f-9cdc-f9028a2de9f6 =adfd5206-8717-4b43-a54d-3fe272c92365 =3ec74fbd-cc10-47ef-92ba-d5d72d465bb9 =52803fef-0be3-4c17-9bda-d64dab9226fb =7fb02e72-cd8a-4a2c-a3ad-f27be0eb9d78
