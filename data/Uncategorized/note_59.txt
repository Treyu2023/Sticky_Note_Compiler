FP 7/8 had a small leak at the bottom of the puming unit in the piping. Tyler and I worked to repir the leaks and test the equipment. All test ok. Pumps 5/6 had no visible leaks we could see. The issues on 7/8 can affect 5/6 due to the sharing of product lines on that side of the store. After repairs were made we were still having issues with the regular on this side of the store stalling. The flex line under FP#5/6 is kinked a bit and may be leaking. Due to the suction system and its location being lower than the union (in-line) check valve the leak is negative (vacuum/suction system) and its location being so that it transitions through the containment sump its very hard to tell what if anything is leaking out of it, but we ran some tests that show its very likely the issue with the regular affecting 5,6,7 and 8. Sending to projects to see about possible fix for line issue. =73ea72a5-7ba5-4502-b7a8-ed968561d9c0 =0c96211d-b29d-42a5-b872-183e05e5246c 14.25-16.25=30910b0d-369e-4e8c-9331-311b83f3d374 16.25-17.5 (61 miles)=36cfcbe5-b95f-4e80-9f7c-59b11efaef62 =eefbb32c-6504-4f7d-aa72-f11ca4806fcf =074d9e4a-f0d2-4846-86fb-078c904b5e32 230103-0369=743b6158-15d1-49d9-b0d7-6c85bdf3874a QC18=1b51844c-f102-41e6-bbd5-ac9cdbc470c8 100US HWY 52 S=4ba5df20-bae6-4ed1-b5c5-fc8857eb4d3d Albemarle=ed8a8164-bc8f-4978-a9bd-1a4be356bcf8 =de33a249-4ebf-4588-8e2b-e2251bb5b15a Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. FP 5/6 was missing the belt for the regular aswell as leaking. I do not have a belt that is the right size with me. I took the belt from the Premium for testing 5/6 Reg. In doing so I noticed the belts are very tight on this dispenser. After replacing the seal on 5/6 regular pumping unit shaft is was still leaking from this area around the packer, this is likely due heavy wear conditions accelerated by the tightness of the drive belt causing a misalignment in the shaft/seal area. I reinstalled the belt on the premium for 5/6 (side B Regular EN00055222) and loosened the tensioner pulley so that the belt was not so tight. We replaced the same seal on FP 7/8 (Side B EN00055224)and experienced the same issues with this fueling positon. Replacing the Pumping unit for both positions is the only reasonable option. Ordering parts expedited as the site is half down. incompleting call.=fcc29b3d-0ca6-4779-ad4d-c301473f8381 =fb5e3f11-740e-4ee8-854a-7ac5a79c2b0d =6bc58703-d383-4f1f-aea2-bc402aaa6cbc =9cad5c88-47c4-497a-97ce-a1e25da3bb4f =f9e410a6-80e2-4509-945f-399322efe258 =94229711-6769-4cf3-8347-d2c71a2382c7 =1c4cfe1b-9b9b-489a-b10a-ef0ae26bf363
