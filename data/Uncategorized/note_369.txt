I downgraded the PCN and upgraded both Door Nodes then upgraded the PCN software back to clear the error codes. The ticket notes did not make sense so I tested the dispenser and there is still no flow on the E88 grade. I brought this to the attention of the manager and asked if I should try to repair the issue not described in the ticket. He gave me the approval to make repairs. I put dispenser in standalone and found the E85 and 88 octane grades were not dispensing at all. I swapped the valve driver board and the Steering valve relay board from another dispenser. This did not work either so I Contacted GVR TAC and I found that the software on this PCN node made it a NJ6, this is not something that can be reversed. The PCN will need to be replaced and loaded with NF4 software (minimum 4.0.21 and a recommended version of 4.0.66.)=1648041b-5af1-4abe-b5af-c4bf62a3b159 will return with parts.

Spoke with Service manager and he is going to try to locate a PCN with software lowe than 4.0.65 installed on it. otherwise upgrading the dispenser side of the unit is the only option as new boards are being shipped with 4.1.30 on them.=0a7a4a5d-8e73-44ac-abb5-394b9c25ad71 =71960258-75aa-462b-9cb6-d07307a6644b =58887bb1-4ffb-4071-a110-4b6d8ea6e6c7 =b48cd009-573e-4848-b5ca-2f06fafd8098
