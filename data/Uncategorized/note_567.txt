I could not replicate the issue with the dispensers stopping. I rebooted the dispensers to rule out 5047 error codes. I rebooted the commander and the BRCM. Once I did this the CRINDs would not come back online. The site is having an issue with the mako box and after troubleshooting with Mako they are sending a replacement Firewall device which should arrive tomorrow and the box should be plug and play. Unfortunately the Mako gives out the rules for the VLAN configuration utilized by the CRIND over IP configuration of the card readers and with it not operational I can not get the card readers back online at any capacity. The dispensers can still be set with cash. Due to the SIM card issue the sites backup internet is not operational and this too will be addressed with the new MAKO device. All work complete at this time.=a81e90bf-ed34-41f9-9747-e0de2f5b0d73 =bb03c3e2-848f-4890-a38c-f5af91bdf43d =7d66d0a2-955e-4b8c-8305-c9f0aafd7621 Bill will be collected on next trip.=6b870629-6076-4de1-84b4-4cf9506be668 =5e57c56a-b1cf-4ddb-8cfc-3cfa3354ed5a =09f92d09-4c54-4747-9e87-6face2f8074d 19.25-20.25 47 miles=bc7a521e-49bc-468a-9331-d5495b0d57a4 20.25-21.25=fc502d0d-3c96-4fd5-ab58-e70360bc15f2 21.25-22.25 47 miles=b75b8977-2d04-4e95-83f9-4b29eb0f037c =2ebb0003-b290-4270-931d-09825402bdb9 Smitys 1 stop=44d3b97f-6134-40df-b15e-d1732f6e6111 716 W Lexington Ave=56c4656d-52a8-48a6-9e50-865dd800fa33 High Point=91175c04-4a7f-423b-98de-e89f1fc0e691 =8accd0e0-a335-4fb7-bf1a-d9a7cdc06161 =5425ed92-0583-4fa4-99f2-d90b45bcdc5a I arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I briefly spoke with Verifone since they were already involved. I found that the RUBY2 was locked up the reset button was broken. I had to take apart the RUBY2 and disconnect the batteryto power it down. Once it was rebooted I tested cards. All test ok.=bea465a9-ea79-435e-8884-4f81f0e50e9b =64042a3c-adce-4e62-bb32-df41b02ade66 =2046154b-7b60-4dcd-b72b-c385f83ae689 =b99f1553-c7bb-47d0-9e56-c4acc7060723 =86d13efa-72ae-42dc-84cb-d71c43abdd2c =c810a5b1-ce63-41f9-a451-bf3f1264f903 =a80ad565-6b0f-4e59-ba3e-10d3df23c514 =eba5f806-a396-4804-b03d-7e28fd1b800f =166932f2-0d80-4cbf-a8a6-3c4c294ad71a =3e38e7de-09cd-4124-8242-9a6185c4249a =c877b174-dd1c-4011-8978-dca0559e92b1 =c3c62b07-fd9e-4a31-9845-5405e632ff0f =95a52599-6eba-4dc9-8332-e9a096d56368 =f6196406-9755-4c95-8568-8ac6f8215c20 =6fcb534e-ba47-4ce7-8cc7-de29bbbcb623 =761a6b43-dbb3-495a-9c18-ebfe4cfb1bb3 =ae8c9c20-9d46-4b45-8efd-261d2f2fd3ac =9d6ad02d-496b-47c8-85ec-ef2c9e2742f2
