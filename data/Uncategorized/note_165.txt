The problem is that with FP 2,3 & 4 powered down the satellitte hose for FP 1 was not operational due to the way it is wired for power. I restored power to FP2 which will not come online due to the current conditions with the water, but this does allow for satellite operations for lane 1. The water leak is still active and has not been contained. No repairs can be performed on 2-4 until the water problem is corrected and water has been evacuated. Due to safety concerns the problem needs to be monitored for changes and shuting down the entire fuel facility should be considered should the conditions in the hazardous area worsen. All test ok.=66b46920-b10c-4892-af1c-ae43b605596b =2a2c9e9b-67da-4239-b1fc-6d781ae2f563 12.75-14.75 84 miles=f0c35406-eccb-43d2-8d69-2659b7cf7153 14.75-15.75=9a743749-932b-4ef7-ae9d-f84f1acf5e6d 221206-0258=c25a153c-8ae4-4710-acf8-7c2747b5fdae Quik Chek #33=550c9308-36a1-4243-b15b-4a1e2222b9d1 2271 E Main St=7577243d-ac0e-4079-b04e-c1e328c76ba0 Ellerbe NC=b6444120-aa30-4831-a406-a0b7a36553a3 =08fdf5c3-84e3-4197-8d35-6cc67aafc1c5 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. FP 3/4 the premium shaft seal was leaking. I replaced it with a brand new shaft seal and inspected all teh parts. After this did not stop the leak I removed it two more times to make sure something was not misaligned such as the square ring gasket. I used combinations of old parts with the new seal and all new seals and gaskets. Nothing would stop the leak, it did become slightly better. The Premium Bennett Type 75D pumping unit is going to need to be replaced. You cant tell watching it but the shaft has to be misaligned which caused the leak to begin with and cant be corrected by the seal replacement.=8b4709b4-56a0-4775-b7bc-8791f2a31693 =37b462f1-c99f-4e2c-9476-90e73f25d7be 15.75-18.25=a5218364-0218-4a3e-8c79-e91bb5c406d3 18.25-19.25 68miles=5d37752d-3478-48b2-aba5-f8c4bf3eb4bc 230114-0073=f8538ed6-3cbe-4097-b646-2e8bf0d0afeb Quik Chek #33=e361af79-8cfc-4e18-9154-6ce4fa6a815d 2271 E Main St=34c35e33-6a4f-4513-8247-f77c5a039544 Ellerbe=ac3b1c50-065b-4f3b-a6b3-ed868aef261c =73f4873f-4683-4983-98c9-30896bbc0dd9 ECRGD4590-BKK1S=174b76f2-d824-4dbc-b664-4cafa0402a9e =65cd4908-ac32-42f6-a040-87439566b3c6 Already on site to work on FP 3/4 Premium Pumping unit leaking on another ticket when I was informed of the POS issue. I replaced the scanner and cable on the Main (only) Register. The register was running slow and I worked with the manager Felicia to reboot the CI and the Ruby2. Everything on the POS is working at this time but based on the issues they are having at this location which seem to be power related I pulled a backup from the CI incase this thing crashes soon. The CI will likely need to be replaced in the coming months. All test ok.
