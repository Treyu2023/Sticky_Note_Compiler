I attempted swapping the Saturn on HDD and chips to  Old commander but Could not repair. I installed the new commander and swap chips and HTV back to new unit. Site had no backup so I reached out to Michael Yates who provided install script and backup from another site. After hours of following script and having to flag PD L2 times because of partial load I got the network processing cards minus loyalty. The dispensers which are weighing DL threes without card readers are still offline and the time keeps changing on the commander without consistency. We'll need to return to iron out these issues.
