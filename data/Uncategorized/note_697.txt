Neither my dispatcher nor I could locate the previous tickets, and discussions with the site manager revealed that while other service providers had inspected the Veeder root, Guardian had not been previously dispatched for these issues, indicating this was not a recall or warranty call.=fc88d1be-d808-4a5d-862a-7eedd4e4b342 =3addf6a8-fb06-49f8-9a63-97ae64726163 Investigation:=fb620c4f-135e-4f88-945e-92c47ba08a49 =de25a4be-f106-448f-b44a-f868faaa1e61 Sensor Status: I discovered that the Regular interstitial sensor (L:4) had registered high liquid alarms on the 3rd, 5th, and 8th of this month, each clearing independently. This behavior typically does not suggest a breach but points to a failing sensor.=33b71e67-edd8-4485-ae2b-9cb8003213e4 Component Verification: I confirmed the sensor's form number (794380-303, model 2251) to facilitate ordering a replacement.=f9a6d7b6-7754-4b04-b14c-e2b39522c6a5 Conclusion:=1a8da960-d10a-40f4-910a-ccae38eaa3a9 Given the intermittent high liquid alarms and the sensor's historical performance, a replacement is warranted. The sensor's failure mode, characterized by a shrinking operational range between high and low alerts, indicates it is nearing the end of its service life. I will return with the replacement part to complete the installation. All preparatory work and diagnostics are complete at this stage.=82679209-d1dc-4dc6-806a-fad4b2dd7580 =9fe321fd-c260-4180-8226-a5bab7fcab27 Veeder Root Serial:=25f192d9-725c-4d95-bd3c-0702db797665 A0368807805001=9837b50b-86e8-4865-a887-2a93264912f5 =2aea3801-1a15-42e0-b84c-bf8c87aac9d5 11.5-12.25 20 miles=76e9075e-ef15-4e93-99e6-83c520acf3ef 12.25-12.75=38cba344-6f7a-4bd2-a2c0-e444a4b1382d 240507-0113=ba260655-1bce-4af0-ab87-2473d1b62457 CAP NC0022=d750504d-aa7f-4621-93e3-1944565dec0a 600 Regional Rd=a4abec9e-6367-4f6c-9b86-10719cbd59d5 Greensboro NC, 27409=4df9e148-070c-4b23-97f7-91446cffa410 =017d5399-c18f-4b92-b3af-c329003af5ac Upon arrival, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and proceeded with the maintenance tasks at fuel position FP#5 (Serial: EN413946).=063b2a9d-cd86-480e-806a-87a450facdab =f4607f1d-ec19-4e12-b604-16f1439ee40c Actions Taken:=5ca0ecb9-2e52-49ca-a4c6-34a239fb4648 =fe46ad49-ac58-43ec-8632-d87f66bca7c6 Breakaway Replacement: I replaced the breakaway device, ensuring it was correctly installed and secure.=b521d4ff-51e9-4f63-b475-d23a00ec6c2d Whip Hose Replacement: Due to noticeable dry rot and extensive wear, I also replaced the whip hose associated with the same fuel position.=14514c0f-fd08-4f23-923c-f1aeb50f3875 Functional Testing: After installing the new components, I conducted a fueling test to check for leaks and verify the integrity of the newly installed hardware.=286184fe-072c-4814-b69e-7dd130f9c61d Conclusion:=74726083-670a-4e5c-b456-d6c2cb6c0e27 The replacement of the breakaway and whip hose was successful, with no leaks detected during the testing phase.

I have placed the ticket on hold and will coordinate to schedule the necessary water removal services. Once the water is evacuated, further checks will be performed to ensure no recurring issues. All immediate investigatory work is complete, pending the resolution of the water accumulation. It appears that the water is coming in around the Containment inner lid, but I cant say there isnt another entry point beneath the surface of the water. Additionally the Outter access lid is fiberglass and missing the handle.=38ea90e7-92ff-42a3-9ad2-57fa6497a231 =ec4412a3-6603-4656-9527-8058d7a7eb01 The other ticket for this site I closed and added the time to this ticket because the issue resolved itself.=a889034f-fe7f-45a6-aa76-a966cc04b005 =3a103e4e-a43e-45a5-ba05-82e2503f5bf7 =127ef993-c1dd-4d5e-8df2-15c2090925de 14-14.5 25 miles=5aae3090-8844-4cc6-be95-1305956617bf 14.5-15.5=e7a11e4a-3347-4921-bd61-694301837b28 =1429231a-9e5f-4275-ab44-da96db578a47 240502-0102=44b471d9-8351-4dcf-89cc-5d507489bdaa PO - FWKD3300041=c3c08784-1a7f-4a46-bfe1-e8be378960f7 CK2720170=e364ff66-f6b2-4897-80f4-4266f15caf54 3101 Pleasant Garden Rd=a5a64ba1-5126-43dd-85e6-bab595141fc7 Greensboro NC, 27406=22cbdffc-c8a7-4b2d-ab69-67887614016e =ed8f8f28-f889-4978-96e8-08db59ab232f Upon arrival, I was unable to locate the reference ticket number in either our internal records or CK Nuvolo, suggesting that this might be Guardian's first involvement with this particular issue.=b6e842db-4373-4587-a4b4-298782d6f882 =1fbb883e-0dce-403b-9177-82b92564d1e1 Investigation:=559a7cca-f241-4486-a693-50893fe1a3a6 =c2ff5d8e-4e1c-443e-a9c0-e20da19df59f Initial Discussion: Consulted with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and proceeded with diagnosing the reported problem.=29c21ec1-5317-445d-bd7a-7cbd404aec3c Sensor Assessment: Direct testing of the sensor under diesel dispenser 11 showed no inherent defects, confirming its functionality.=4a272fab-087f-46e8-b4a2-89eba9fa94b4 Wiring Inspection: The primary issue was identified within the wiring system:=f82a2773-0a91-481d-997e-a94017d57971 The shield/grounding cable of the Belden (2C w/Shield + bare GRND) cable was disconnected at both ends, which could lead to interference issues.=69825b9c-01f3-4d0b-a585-366bc84bc112 A short was found between the black wire and the shield/ground, with resistance around 6 ohms, indicating a wiring fault.=aee36f63-1c65-4d15-9cc9-88aedb6ca8a4 Disconnected shield/grounding cables and shorts suggest improper installation or previous damage.=32d047c4-a95b-4c50-8c06-c4770acfabd4 Technical Details:=2b9a8218-ebb6-423d-937b-9e4299b6a091 =62d72bea-b145-410f-aa62-8cef5202337a Resistance Measurements: The wiring’s resistance measurements were higher than expected for the estimated length and gauge (18 AWG), indicating potential damage or excessive length contributing to electrical resistance.=168652de-6128-4602-895f-a6e683f31a34 Conclusion:=59a768c0-cae0-42f8-97b1-3980473fe5f0 The findings point to a need for repair or replacement of the damaged wiring to resolve the interference and connectivity issues accurately. I have escalated this ticket for further action and placed it on hold while a detailed repair quote is prepared. Recommendations include securing all wiring connections and ensuring proper shielding practices are followed to mitigate future interference. The site setup, particularly the flex conduit's positioning inside near the ATG, suggests previous modifications which might have compromised the wiring integrity. All observations have been documented for further review and action.=0cc2956a-36c0-4b36-b020-321fe0650afd =e786ee83-321f-4400-8ddd-4c26ca05f3b3 Ω
