It came to light that the site had experienced a fuel outage, which triggered an alarm in the MAG VFC due to the low fuel levels. Furthermore, the key to the electrical room, which is necessary for our access to the MAG FVC, is currently missing.=2d084cc3-1739-46ec-9ff6-bd2efe6d7f05 =ea70c69d-cc51-41b3-8874-26c3eb34504f I advised Mr. Preston to engage the services of a professional locksmith to regain entry into the room and to address the issue of the missing key. In the interim, I have shared my contact details with him as I will be unable to remain on-site to await the locksmith's arrival.=0f33d65f-7255-4ae1-bffb-0b542b67d4ec =bbb91ba2-8146-4336-8c00-3efa8cf6c502 I am keeping the current ticket in a pending status and will continue monitoring the situation. Should Mr. Preston provide an update or should I manage to revisit the site later this evening, I will promptly act on the new information. The resolution of this issue remains a priority.
