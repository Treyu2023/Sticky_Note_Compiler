THis prompted me to pull logs, I found that this dispenser has dumped its programming. After another power cycle I started getting E4 ( Some processed failed to start on bootup) I went to replace the PCN and found that the one I have can not be used here because the weights and measures switch compatability. I will need to return with parts.=6b3a7cb7-ff9a-4a74-aded-c3c06465e28e =0389b45b-dfae-4eff-88c1-626c8e358882 13 - 15.25 RTL=713ba55a-3c8e-49ae-b8f6-53d93e15618b =7d2bf417-52ee-4eb7-84cf-99474d2f3334 VMS - 132108=4c8893cf-dbcb-43d9-94cc-9bfc8e431ce6 PO - 189470316=6baa078f-8bbf-4154-9717-35b624f8fcf6 =22de3489-3648-473c-929a-17b51f8bb85b Pump 24 when I looked at it and put it in standalone the manager turned off the breker to the dispenser. Stating that a customer told him the screen was black, if this was performed when someone was fueling on the other side of the dispenser.Then it would have interupted the sale. in  some cases the sale will not autosettle and as a result this usually is handled as a drive off this issue would be with the NCR EPS though. as far as the dispenser I pulled dispenser logs and there were alot of UART parity errors and a few over run errors but those were for side A FP#23 and they do not specify the grade. I put the dispenser in standalone and tested both sides with preset amounts of .1 and .5 gallons and could not duplicate any over runs while in standalone. Before leaving the manager mentioned that dispenser 19 was having the same issue as 24. I ran the BRCM tool and it updated all 13 devices. This will likely fix the issue we are seeing here. =b9b0ed7d-30c5-430d-a0d6-23cc7233c5bd =1db0bf06-d834-41f6-9b72-03a64a8cbca1 =f0d82eb7-d687-4091-be03-e4bd79ff680c =886fc306-0ed6-418f-baf6-6dd959ac2bb8 15.25 - 16.25 RTT=befc0b1f-7c46-407c-8a9a-dd91f9421cfd 16.25 - 17.5 RTL=b73e6ec6-6f45-436c-b8c8-9162517816ff 17.5 - 18 RTTDH=ebdeedc8-49ba-4a51-b4f0-34468a78035f =6d38e579-9c9a-4f40-a03c-f415202a5bfc VMS  - 132054=b867eee2-f927-4a21-944d-41a6b8709700 PO - 187610682=83addb37-d9a5-42fb-b560-503be2732564 =9acc8390-d585-4362-b07c-e8f1b1b4721c RT=47dcad3e-11ba-4aba-899f-c20d8a8295a5 2434 Buckingham =02daff46-8b54-4647-a4d1-61c403649392 Garland=00961b59-e2bf-48e0-ae8a-e152114a3ab8 =64ae4130-92f1-40b1-9289-38c59f1ebc74 Arrived on-site, checked in with SC and MOD.
