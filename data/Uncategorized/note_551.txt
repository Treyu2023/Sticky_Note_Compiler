FP # 2 was showing 5150 (PPU's not addressed correctly) error code on the regular and mid grade PPU's when the nozzle was removed. I was able to remove the PPU tray and clean the connections with a solvent. I also cleaned the soor node and cable ends. I reinstalled the components and re-activated the card reader. This cleared up the issue.

The HDD was dead so i went and picked one up from the shop in Kernersville. I returned to the site and installed the HDD. the procedure failed to restore the Tlog backups and I had to contact GVR TAC to assist with manually restoring these backups. Once comepleted I cleared teh backup mismatch errors for the EDH and got the dispensers and the network working. The PIN Pad was not working still though. We contacted shell (Case#13346261 - 133911) after some troubleshooting found that the PIN Pad cable was not plugged into the right port on the passport. once we made this change the PIN Pad started working and we were able to test EMV debit inside successfully.
