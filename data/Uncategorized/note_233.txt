I proceeded to replace the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) printer with a refurbished ESC714-0006 Printer (TSSP-PTR, TLM, OLD-STYLE) under warranty. Please note that this was not added to the ticket or transferred to the truck inventory. The initial issue was that the print appeared light in certain areas, making it difficult to read.=cc4d5bca-2df9-4c38-b627-d6c75a11fe63 =f23af2fc-8deb-4645-82cb-43f87bf30a05 After installing the replacement printer, the print quality remained largely unchanged. I conducted a comparative test using the supplied test paper and the paper currently in use at the site. There was a noticeable difference in the darkness of the thermal ink properties between the two samples.=391fa60d-3b10-4a92-8d75-9de5599fbf94 =e366bf27-3286-4863-b50b-584cd18720f2 Based on my findings, I concluded that the issue was not with the printer itself, but rather the quality of the thermal receipt paper being used. I recommended that the site procure higher-quality thermal receipt paper to resolve the issue. I left the test samples for Gene to review upon his arrival. All tests were completed successfully, and the printer is functioning properly.=7c914677-15a3-47c4-84f9-4fbb9c62820d =20eb9bde-a1f2-4868-88c6-9211e9508a1b =d9ce348e-9b41-461f-861a-07584d5fe354 14-14.25 10 milies=36c0638d-a677-471d-a39e-3bc2a5762edf 14.25-14.75=658c7787-fb3f-44b8-811e-022a22f3b984 14.75-17 86 miles=5a8cf002-7bb6-4eec-90b9-fab672a982cc 230501-0379=d9db2b3c-7a61-45bf-ba37-729add9a237c PO - 67487098=1b55eaa0-6a14-4676-a6da-3e2b1bff3ea1 GPM 00522=8ec902f4-c217-43e1-a9c6-a8ee2c2067f6 6015 Huell Matthews HWY=f0adf4e9-2651-405d-aa9f-02fc3cac2108 South Boston 24592=226e6e61-47ca-4efe-a619-0588a6d608f0 =a142950a-eba9-456f-8215-c12244b82924 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in through Verisae and consulted with the Manager on Duty (MOD). The reported issue involved the non-responsive softkeys surrounding the monochrome display on all dispensers. Although the keys produced a beeping sound when pressed, there was no change in the display.=28932a39-7a0a-4489-9cf9-bfbf9a943208 =5a68059e-5129-4d7d-8f77-3c5eb54dab13 To resolve the issue, I reloaded the card readers from the register, which successfully restored the softkey functionality. Additionally, I noticed slow site processing, prompting me to reboot both the Commander and Wincor systems. During the reboot process, I discovered a non-operational fan on the Commander; however, I managed to unjam it, restoring its functionality.=3e3e60d9-6646-408a-8b1a-d841f4123763 =6933e20a-a379-401c-b17d-2b305d9cfa1e I provided the site operator with instructions on rebooting the Commander and recommended performing this action once a week as a preventive measure, if possible. Following these interventions, all tests were conducted and yielded satisfactory results
