The main issue identified was with the Topaz system, which was reportedly failing on every alternate transaction initiated from the Point of Sale (POS).=11abfb91-798b-4fb0-ae5d-365955f8234a =687bac7d-717b-4b50-acf8-301a54619fd3 In consultation with Nadeem from Verifone, we agreed to automatically upgrade to a newer software version, 3.12.34 from 3.12.33, which had been uploaded to the portal. This action was taken with the expectation that it would rectify the frequent transaction failures.=bfa973c1-a14c-4050-812d-0bf6902c902c =5e1dcca9-a94d-44a2-9db0-163cf25ac1e9 Simultaneously, I also inspected the T2 Regular fuel and found that the fuel was contaminated. I promptly brought this issue to Nadeem's attention.=97e0b423-3de1-43ce-9403-62b2e887c44f =e8c203a4-5bd3-499a-b1ca-4e144657fe8c Following the software upgrade, I carried out various tests to ensure that fuel setting and card usage had returned to normal operation. All tests were satisfactory. The POS system appears to be functioning correctly after the software upgrade, and I will follow up regarding the contaminated fuel issue.=b8b4d8b5-af58-498a-8904-80039f51e873 =ca328a50-8cf7-4f21-a630-2c1af1545560 13.25-14.5 50 miles=3d54e12f-7820-4dff-8f9d-227a1ece69c6 14.5-16.75=c8dc06ac-5888-41cd-9ca0-c7a0ef5ab807 230724-0418=d0a001ce-951f-4370-bee8-026ff1815118 Allens Citgo (REO)=270b220d-0550-4e65-90c9-8fad07d66c5a 2107 N Church St=df4fb0d1-64e8-47e2-acd4-305f9ac0fb0e Greensboro NC 27405=df4bc5ea-6070-4481-aaa1-8b0019be3799 =a413c973-f115-439f-b1c3-25a3b001ac3d Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The PIN Pad is installed on a Passport POS. I could not replicate the issue, but the site ensures me that it is happening several times a day and the Pin Pad does look old. Ordering replacement. =6b92188f-f49a-408e-addb-db7472289f08 =3e8db209-ffee-4793-9784-80d46270072a =29aee59b-cf6f-4208-9753-a5b62d8d021a
