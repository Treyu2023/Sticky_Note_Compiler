FP 10 displayed a sign indicating a malfunction with the card reader, which I removed to perform diagnostic tests. FP 3 showed a red 'X' with a card through it on the screen.=fa395121-9f3b-46ab-bb48-5dcae1b3ce8e Diagnostic Testing: Conducted tests on the card readers at FP 3 and FP 10. Both positions showed issues that necessitated a system reboot and further testing.=61b65940-12be-4a18-8bdb-edeb25ed96fb Commander Registration and EMV Initialization: The primary issue involved the site Commander's registration. I successfully registered the site Commander and initialized EMV settings. I then initialized EMV and rebooted the Commander this critical step was necessary to bring the card readers at FP 3 and FP 10 back to operational status.=43cf3fde-46d0-4d9e-883f-6de85867dc1a Resolution and Conclusion:=a7b76986-8a8f-4e03-9fe1-2f28349a980a =b38d1198-2f97-4698-bb44-424060d95914 Restoration of Card Reader Functionality: Following the reboot, registration and the EMV initialization of the Commander, both FP 3 and FP 10's card readers returned to a working state, resolving the primary issue.=861c05d3-9fdd-42f9-83f7-4fe4bbb475af Verification of Functionality: Final tests confirmed that all systems were now functioning properly, with no further issues reported.=93558573-ab25-4cd6-94ea-68763ba222e8 This intervention not only addressed the immediate functional issues at the fuel positions but also resolved the underlying registration complications with the site Commander, ensuring stable operations moving forward.=b24ce7bb-440c-44c4-ac05-aca0539edda4 =d1d2a71b-a834-43c2-9e82-ce3a0122fcf6 11.5-12.5 45 miles=1dd65329-91d8-4ccd-b9cd-8589134e8b92 12.5-13.75=2a37b1f6-0996-4764-9d1b-60f06b3c3f44 240425-0245=d0b8e475-da17-43c2-b5c2-17987c824d2f Jones Food Market=306c207f-5532-4bf8-a0f4-56848b725d55 6340 Mount Cross Rd=cb10ac18-dff5-4056-9a4f-ab3fa3bc2c22 Danville VA, 24540=edcc24c3-3189-43b7-92ca-c02c382dccc6 =96f9bd51-bc9c-46ba-af1b-ee201064ad70 Upon arriving on-site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and began investigating an issue with the card readers at Fuel Position (FP) 4. This problem has become common across various Verifone sites that have recently upgraded to a new contactless outdoor EMV-capable version, even at sites like this one that lack contactless equipment.=22013d31-dcae-4bff-9152-135d90453d8c =79f5c02b-f837-45cb-981a-e6872962b157 Investigation and Actions Taken:=6c3deb31-1063-453a-b924-6353fede696b =f67bd6d4-7675-4566-bf23-69c7f8a0a613 Initial Troubleshooting: Initially, the standard approach of rebooting the Controller and purging the affected fuel positions did not resolve the issue. However, after adjusting settings within the Commander and repeating the process, the card reader began functioning properly.=508e96c3-c3de-4f82-ba74-d5da1ffdc3cf Testing and Verification: The indoor PIN Pad responded correctly on the first attempt for both Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, indicating that the indoor system was not affected by the same issue.=9e5e787a-52af-47a6-a985-bbb44d060ad1 Diagnosis and Site Recommendation:=9b5fa4fb-a8b6-4be3-b6cc-0f7e9028af14 =76862704-527d-49f5-b4a5-e610a146fe2e Software-Related Issue: The recurring problems appear to be linked to the newer software version installed on the systems. Although replacing the card reader could be a solution, it is not recommended unless the reader itself is malfunctioning. In this case, the difficulties are primarily software-related.=49ffd1ad-d78d-45b8-84ab-5abe88835b87 Preventative Measures: I advised the site to reboot the Commander weekly to mitigate these issues, a practice that could help maintain system stability given the current software environment.=ba720ceb-a184-4662-a7ab-5aae9261d6e4 Conclusion:=1f5ea9bb-ddd5-48eb-8822-c87a850610cd The intervention adjusted the operational settings successfully, enabling the card reader at FP 4 to function as intended after the second attempt. The advice to reboot the Commander regularly should help in managing any similar issues moving forward, ensuring that the system remains functional despite the software challenges. All systems tested subsequently confirmed proper functionality.=a878307e-4e09-4ab1-9f59-87bef5dcaee5 =2ab1537d-ba7a-4b96-b426-d3f088e70a5d =916c310b-af3d-4f79-ba3e-48789015d217 13.75-14.25 20 miles=904dd55b-48ea-4eb3-bb3b-9f7cb81a7174 14.25-15.5=bc3487ad-6f01-4c99-a61d-2f7cab44e6c9 15.5-16.75 60 miles=995e940e-9d66-48b7-8638-3e359a7317d7 PO - ABE=e97b6d78-78b3-4010-a636-330ba1a1288a 240425-0306=5b939f46-2f42-43b0-9453-71a4037f6998 GPM# 1510=7d39b090-7e58-4900-bc36-226afd8aa3fa 2262 N Main St=e383a03e-086e-41bb-a012-11a706420953 Danville VA, 24540=f5661c0a-96e7-485b-8284-dfd1e2aaa437 =23ea3e82-5922-4e82-bae2-f23fcc5c9549 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and began investigating issues related to the printer and the tank monitor.=7c25baec-86c2-4b65-bc8d-2dd1647b546b =0b30d45d-7b3b-493f-9022-7857ea1e0a44 Investigation and Actions Taken:=220e411a-11a9-40b5-83b8-e8f109f4f0a1 =fded875a-3475-4869-85e4-e2fa8de11b28 Printer Issue: I discovered that the problem with the printer was due to the thermal paper being old and degraded, which I demonstrated to the site using a lighter. The paper did not darken as expected before igniting, indicating it was no longer functional due to age rather than being the wrong type.=d46f2fc9-f88d-4d14-a06b-d5181c1b373d Tank Monitor Concerns: The owner, Abe, mentioned a test failure on the tank monitor, which is an Incon TS variant. Upon reviewing the leak test results and acknowledging the active alarms, I found a reported leak rate of -0.78 gallons per hour ono the Regular Unleaded Tank, which is significantly high and indicative of a substantial issue.=47c86438-dee9-4530-b261-e26cbacce04c Diagnosis and Recommendations:=0697bd53-1c8b-4942-80d4-f1f8f4dc5af3 =9a1dca1c-7fcc-49e1-ac5e-3a78fe7230e9 Printer Resolution: I advised the site to replace the old thermal paper with new stock to resolve the printing issues.=114502e2-2cd7-476e-a6bf-40ceb46f717d Tank Monitor and Leak Test: Given the alarming leak rate indicated by the tank monitor, I recommended that Abe hire a third-party company to conduct a thorough tightness test on the site's lines and tanks to accurately determine the source of the leak, whether it be an actual leak or a malfunction in the monitoring equipment.=8691057d-04b0-4271-ab14-940a934b6af6 Conclusion:=bb3cfaab-e909-4a12-8fbc-f87d3301f30c The site was advised on corrective measures for both the printer and potential leak issues. The printer problem was immediately rectified with new paper. The site wa advised to replace their stock with fresh paper, while the suspected leak necessitates further investigation by 3rd Party tank/line testing company to ensure environmental safety and operational integrity.=eadc3ea2-bf3d-404d-9f47-1068676c5770 =4cc03d20-08a7-4c2c-9b40-3258da031bbe =42a1ffb8-0efd-4b00-ae32-880ca0e7bdee
