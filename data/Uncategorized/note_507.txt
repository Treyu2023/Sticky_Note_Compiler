The Managed switch had several amber (no Comms) ports. on reboot all but 2 turned green. I determined the two amber ports were for the site controller and the fuel controller, I rebooted both of these devices and the BRCM but it returned the same results. I contacted RTSS and Kamisha and I determined that we should put in a NCR ticket to replace both the fuel controller and the site controller.
