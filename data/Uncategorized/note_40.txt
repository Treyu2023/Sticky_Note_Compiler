It was discovered that a stuck sale, originating from an outdoor CRIND transaction, had occurred. During this transaction, a customer experienced a system lock-up at the CRIND, which subsequently caused the Fuelling Position to lose communication with the Point Of Sale (POS) system.=7fb17c07-15e4-4014-bd14-9ac975fc57af =5cfdb1a5-e31d-4141-8c67-cbe92381782d Corrective Actions:=7ec5c1f8-bc7e-493c-9a23-b74386f8f91e =7488c849-461d-40e9-991e-15ea25cdc8ee Clearing Stuck Sale: The primary step was to clear the stuck sale to restore the system's usual operation.=b908b999-3c69-4040-bd2e-6e26ddf3b26a =3b2fd0e3-ec55-496c-9c4a-c8a751632d90 EDH Reboot: After clearing the sale, I rebooted the Electronic Dispenser Head (EDH) to reinitiate communication between the systems.=f4523609-048d-4036-a07e-3aed07d0c957 =fc099088-4a50-47c6-8783-cd4882d6f950 Monitoring and Testing: Post-reboot, I closely monitored the communication status of Dispensers 3/4 to ensure stability. Further, a card transaction was executed on Fuel Pump (FP) 4, where the stuck sale occurred, to validate that no residual issues persisted.=34b711d6-68eb-4aeb-b339-df3927bd9490 =d8a38db4-3c8d-42b2-98b9-bcc2ee4c1a4b Conclusion:=5599cefa-f30c-48e1-ad8a-ab320851fd66 All interventions resulted in the restoration of the systems to their optimal functioning state. Rigorous testing was performed to guarantee that the communication between the systems was stable and that there were no lingering issues. Everything is now in perfect working condition.=0d3504fa-53bb-49ed-962e-9a0802c06fc9 =2338834e-3549-4a87-bc88-ac526e097631 12-13 Lunch=1a709fa7-9b98-4fae-9cd5-dd3cf496770f =da06d12c-c0a2-42cf-b940-b4870d538ded 13-14 45 miles=a607f886-1d0f-4c6e-a60b-96715f12d2b0 14-18=089f0281-aa2b-454a-ae95-b3f9423d0780 18-19 54 miles=eb6d4796-831c-42e5-b6b3-2f97c70f67d6 Tankers=6a8186fe-bb99-48ca-84b7-eeeabebc149a 4020 HWY 8=63be4acd-f940-473f-af58-d85557744ee7 Lexington NC, 27292=b6dabdee-0e9f-4cb7-b161-481c1618663e =59dd5cb7-8d34-4bc7-80fc-3883d9cc442c Arrived on-site, checked in with Corey and the site personell. Corey replaced the UPM on dispenser 6 while I gathered all of the Citgo Rewards udated info from Verifone Premier Portal. Together we ran over the Loyalty configuration documentation and programmed the Commander with this information. We then included the manager and went through a couple of transactions to fine tune the loyalty program the way they had it before. The Marlboro rewarrds program they were running has no documentation on Verifones portal and Citgo was unable to help us with the configuration. We reached out to Chris and discussed with him. After some back and forth together we determined the best course of action here would be to have Chris contadct the back office people and configure or assist in configuring the loyalty remotely tomorrow. If they need a tech on site Chris is to reach out to Guardian and inform us. In the meantime I have cleared with Chris for us to go ahead and complete this ticket as theres nothing else we can do at this time. The loyalty network for Citgo Is up and working the only thing not at this time is the Marlboro program. All test ok.=67ea747f-c260-495d-ac87-644e2a9539e3 =ef140ce4-16db-404e-8f64-ab7214844370 =94748099-6043-4da7-9a31-6ae4dd236921 =01250e04-03c7-4200-9542-f08b0b4c1e7f =8fb767f4-dea2-4c97-8814-57f1598dbc81 =5190d3b8-4c37-4422-a43c-1b00935e13a4 =158f4e68-b32e-4ece-a220-a62e096c529f =efcd57a4-bf19-4890-8666-b1ba9bbe10a9 =568d72fd-2370-4fbc-88be-f7bff2b9c7b0 =350f7231-032e-472a-b50b-e5ed583625b7 =68b43517-62e2-4430-8189-45b0c25b7166
