FP#1 was displaying "One Moment Please" on the CRIND display. I purged the CRIND & it came back to a normal prompt. Tested card transaction. I re-routed the cables on the back of the door to further separate the data from the ground cables. I also checked the printer and leaded paper. Once finished I warm started the dispenser.

I checked the ATG which showed a leak rate of 2-3 GPH. The line diagnostic history shows seating pressure of 5 PSI. I closed the ball valve and ran a line test to isolate the check valve. I replaced the check valve & the problem persisted. So then I opened the manual relief screw and was about to replace the o-rings when a customer turned on the motor for 9-16 which caused a small leak of less than 3 gallons, I contained and cleaned up the fuel. Thats when I realized I was not on the correct line, I took all precautions, but there was nothing indicating which STP was which other than the ATG tank names of east and west (1-8 is fed by T2 which was labelled west inside but in fact turns out this is the east position.) Once I cleaned up the mess I took the check valve I removed from the wrong STP qand installed it in the correct STP. I then tested with the new (Used) check valve but it would not hold. I went to go look at the o-rings on the manual pressure reliefe screw after pressurizing the line from tests to find the line was actually leaking at the tri-clover clamp fitting. I was able to turn the thumb screw about 4.75 times around so it was not very tight . After tightening the fitting I ran a line test (.2 GPH) and got it to pass. It held over 20 PSI for the duration (30-45 minutes) I then placed 1-8 back in service.

I replaced this part on FP3. The Q1 issue I was able to resolve by running a line test but I had to get people to stop using the regular product since the site did not bag the Mid Grade customers were causing the test to abort.
