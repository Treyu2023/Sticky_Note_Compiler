I tested a dispenser to find there wasn't even a prompt for the Car Wash when using a card at the pumps. after testing the dispenser there was a loud noise nearby and the dispensers lost power we were able to reset them from the power control pan el. The store's power remained on. I think a transformer a block away or so blew. I could not access the Commander to check the configuration of the car wash. I rebooted the car wash device then I went into the back trying to trace the cable and I found the cable is going to a different place then the commander and it had a Gilbarco adapter on the end of it. Speaking with the manager it sounds like the car wash has not worked since the winter storm. I ran the cable from  the old rack to the new server rack amd p;ugged it into A2-7 which is where the car wash is programmed this cleared the communicagtion error temporarily but I could not get the car wash to prompt on the CRINDs. I believe either the adapter or configuration of the Ryko IV device needs ot be changed. I do not have the adapter needed nor any instructions for the Car Wash equipment. I contacted Marcus with GPM and explained the situation to him. Completing ticket on Verisae. Ryko tech will need to provide correct adapter and troubleshoot their equipment.=f5b69f59-7ee0-4b2c-a3e9-df3927950619 =96a7c9cb-659f-4373-9c26-a406d9153d53 9.75 - 10.75=80139dbd-0eff-4cd3-ba21-b2d2633ba6bc 10.75 - 14=23794a26-043d-4366-bc9d-0cb53a8ec4c3 =80108b18-0e5a-4e40-8dad-6ed742548332 Tom Thumb (gathered info from TLS 450)=9d5432ac-d9c2-4dda-8e12-d0ddb33d5491 =529de3a3-a103-41ba-ac74-f63e731004ea =05ad9999-4047-45aa-8603-9b7d8cf5231b Parker Rd RT=1360acd3-2181-47d9-8fe4-d44cf613609f 15.25 - 15.75=613c8f57-8468-41d0-a8f7-6c2d393e6294 15.75 - 16.5=e5bdcbd3-c091-4608-b508-53d4efd2dc0c =f162f2cc-f7fe-4134-b710-1c9b8f16ff9b 16.5 - 17 RTTDH=0a494cf4-25ef-48be-bf81-2410b3bfc7a5 =90975f2a-804a-49a5-801d-8e91d646e563 =9473de80-5519-4358-8c79-3adfbc900454 =a2ddafdf-c8e2-4b83-aa5d-5d2293ce5a75 =5e2c79f9-30f6-4769-a6e2-209ccf9536bc =b21d69df-d8d9-4ae2-a276-ad96526a63ee
