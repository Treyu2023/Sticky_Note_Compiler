I was carrying parts ordered by the previous technician.Communication with Mr. Patel: Upon contacting Mr. Patel, he informed me that the first three issues listed on the ticket had already been resolved during the initial visit. The only outstanding issue was with FP 3, which was not dispensing Regular UNL.Repair and Testing:Lower Lock Repair on FP 3:=localId_5ef8a25284d24537b480b860b226ea68 I repaired the lower lock on FP 3 by greasing the components and removing the broken key portion that was stuck inside.Valve Replacement:=localId_e819516293694d018b9ddd1f55638c4c I checked and replaced the 3-bolt digital valve on FP 3 Regular.Final Testing and Monitoring: After completing the repairs, I tested the operation of FP 3 and monitored customers using this position while finishing the paperwork. All tests were successful, and the dispenser is now functioning correctly. Before leaving they brought to my attention that FP 4 card reader had became noperable. On investigating I found that it was offline purgind did not bring it up so I rebooted the CI this brought it back online but now it was not taking a EMV cip card. Diagnostics showed it was reading mag stripes and chips ok with 0 failures but the fact that this was a Citgo I immediately knew what the issue was. I got into the CI and initialized EMV and tested since we just rebooted but no dice. I still had to reboot the CI immediately following the Initialization of EMV on that position before it became operational again. I explained this to the manager and also we had to contact the owner to get the password. All work complete and all test ok
