I ran and passed a line test on Q:6 (E85) and this cleared alarms. I monitored for a minute and it failed a test. The history shows 3 fails in the last week. I replaced the STP check valve. The spring, check valve as well as the housing cavity were coated in the unknown contaminant best described as a gel or soft setting glue.  This interferes with the operation of the PLLD system. Causing the valve to not seal. It is working now after cleaning and replacing the check valve, but this is not correcting the contaminant issue. All test ok.=localId_34c6e46a69b447079081ed43065a3a34 =localId_79b20fdc67dc4211873b989ea0f758f9 =localId_e7f81ab590074ce3bbd8eba3a4209eb9 15-15.5=localId_1d862769308242c58e202b6508fe5450 15.5-16.5=localId_2ccf7c6350984edf8fb0bf1884242f2c 135560=localId_044be33f9e83409ebc9d046737b86105 FWKD3819175=localId_563f53b3c91b4dafb1ef4ebbda2b89ec 711 - 36673=localId_1e8312e680b64ad59263e65d92b2d44e 1280 S Loop 288=localId_a06ee564287848f68a7cac5b3edbff44 Denton=localId_5aae6f39fb274ee1b6992b16ebecbe79 =localId_5ea2f635cf6e4d01b5ef43b6a5a736b6 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.  FP#3 was online outside and on the register. I tested a card at the dispenser & unbagged it. Problem seems to have been POS/Controller related and has been resolved.
