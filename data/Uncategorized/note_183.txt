Both sides of the dispenser were loaded with CRK2 encryption keys. I reloaded RKL for FP # 4 (EN00230820) After this did not work I attempted to replace the PIN Pad configuration through the M7 tool unsuccessfully. I then reloaded the software on the UPM. Afterwards I tested both sides of the dispenser to find both 3 and 4 were giving the invalid PIN. I then pulled a system health report from FP 1 and found the encryption type was SHL3. 3/4 were loaded with CRK2. I rkl'd 4&4 UPM with the SHL3 key and tested EMV debit transaction. All test ok.=77b8ae0f-ae87-4b4b-bff2-443f52f08674 =46bc3f94-8bbb-4fa5-ac22-4babe1d61122 11.5-13.25 33 miles=cd250945-7878-4556-824b-11f187dd7a07 13.25-14.5=771bbe6e-c0f8-49b5-902a-3e3b407bb674 230203-0214=72510ce3-4f36-4f9b-bc64-3b3d6a493f65 Ryder 1526=e732301a-6d7b-4f86-a977-9a46478acd92 check in - 013040=6058ce00-0fb2-4b59-92a5-54e25db0137b check out - 033724=e993082a-d11b-4202-b334-bacbf0621da8 PO - 465842=a173f865-c2b4-4641-8382-1965829cb2a8 8024 Industrial Village Rd=93875269-5e4a-4965-8e94-60053fbb7fdd Greensboro=fc205a31-9768-4b47-ba11-bda9978c6223 =9a64dd15-7af9-4b25-ab7d-6886c871a2d5 steve blue one 404-216-9975=4828fab5-814b-4c32-aac0-06bd348ebdb5 =7d038c26-1680-48fa-afdf-9fb34484bc58 770-688-1958=734514fb-0429-4f16-8162-90c1c8610aaf customerservice@blue#1energy.com=06247d30-2ae4-4346-b33f-89a4864e9aca =bd632c7a-4ae4-46cb-b885-8cad127527af Blue1 wants me to visually inspect the fluid by removing the top and =e97cf9ea-54b1-4781-bcdf-eab8101fd733 =4bb1ac31-a4b5-4c6a-8473-aef0ba19fc34 606-900-0=33c962b3-eceb-4b3c-b16b-ab080522e234 =96e85960-dcc7-4c89-b3e1-40b7628335af request=9c68d2b0-b670-43a6-9565-9fc3ddd4cd60 =f1972c24-b1c0-4ad1-a9b8-1106a8e8282e Arrived on site, checked in with Ryder IVR phone line and with Facilities maintenance lead bruce. He explained to me that the hose reel is rusted through ( we already are replacing this once we order parts) Bruce also explained that the Bennet Inline meter is jamming and they have to beat on it with a hammer to dispense. On inspection the unit has leaks on top of the tank and at the reel, this is allowing air to accumulate in the meter portion and is causing crystals to form which is jamming the meter. Nothing can be done about this before the leaks are fixed without comprimising any replacement parts I believe the reel being used is a Samson 505 series reel. I was unable to find a model number on the reel itself. I attached pictures of the meter leaks, hose reel and any data plates I could find. Ordering parts. =33bb4d60-21bc-4b26-9840-ad0480bea43e =079b03b3-df83-499a-b189-34c34b49ad80 14.5-16=d84b6a5f-0bce-42e7-afd7-fa54348f2e71 16-17 39 miles=2894c9e7-d29e-41bf-995f-42426db95057 =97de40c7-caa8-4a7f-932f-5213984158ec Ryder/Fedex=b4d16eea-7a21-4b21-abc7-56de51b5fcb7 8200 Triad Dr =bc47354c-7420-4052-a592-8145ba11c4cd Greensboro=55f07992-6678-4f43-ba53-32633e70f2f0 SR - 13533413=0cdbd443-ddd6-42b1-9905-01760aee97ae Q3790472 check in=a0367cb2-7e5a-4ec4-a3bf-85361aedf314 =8a38d91c-cf39-4e7b-b75f-2dcade90bfe2 =afb5c889-2956-424c-8e28-1b493b1ebc73 Arrived on-site, checked in with Facility maintenance and GVR FMS SR. I checked the results of Q:1 (this is the only line at the site). The disp[ensers were dispensing when I arrived and the hostory checks out. PLLD tests are auto running after dispense and all functions are normal on the Veeder Root. All test ok. I was unable to checkout with the FMS phone line it keeps telling me theres a system error.
