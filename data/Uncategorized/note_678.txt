The register was stuck on starting app. I was unable to recover it to load software so I rode to the shop got a replacement and returned to install it. All test ok.=7c2e9867-08a9-4eb5-ac35-031f39957430 =ad7c8c88-d3b2-4eeb-abb8-5b62eef01358 =4e396abc-5130-4751-b32a-dcd4539f06a1 VFNM169-000-01-NAA-R=460518fe-9938-4f44-a2ff-4d19766b3c67 IN - 216-510-388=e73d2a2c-7981-43d9-b3f5-82936c52fee5 PUT - 216-372-165=409d3b1e-619b-41a3-ae06-ae01690716ea =2cdee2f3-0547-4e75-bbca-7510a07f554d =1044a1fd-5225-4cb8-a358-690215dac88c Satvler=8fdece26-1933-443b-9701-52e047f0268f 3:45-17:30=b88e623c-9f2c-40a3-90ed-63115bd333a8 17:30-18:30 62 miles=2200d2a4-15d9-40b9-9663-1460808c4396 =eeb66e59-d8c7-49a9-ab50-e749a9c28369 Sadlers Grocery=6bcb8e13-778d-4c72-b6ef-6f99bc95865e 2021 HWY 14 =caf9bfb6-84d5-4023-9ce2-4dda354c4203 Reidsville NC, 27320=05aa9d82-078d-4644-965e-95df286dcd42 =5f030408-54d7-463a-b5b4-9eef6c2be643 Arrived on-site, initially the cards were working. I found a PDI Cybera device unplugged and offline I restored its connection giving an online light. This device and the HUghes box I believe is for the lottery are plugged into a switch that is linked to another switch that is feeding the WAN port on the Paysafe. I contacted Payafe and found that the 4g backup is not working because for some reason the SIM Card has been de-activated. The rep stated that he was re-activating it but that the network could take 24 hours before it reflects those changes. At that time they will be able to see into the box and provide diagnostics data. As far as I can tell the register equipment iis working fine just the network p[roblems. The site is rebooting all of the network equipment under the counter to restore the connection but its only temporary until it returns. I beleive they may have another network mixed into their connection to the modem in the back and it is dragging the system down. I checked all the cables associated with the payment and the CI portion of the network. I spoke with the owner NICK and explained to him that he needs to contact the internet and the paysafe helpdesks tomorrow when they should be able to access teh site.=c4f2b137-913f-468c-8fe6-fa607be6ae6c =f3e70ac7-3d6c-471b-8832-ba950565cf90 =0bf39e09-ddbb-4138-b8db-4e2678368425 =07855f13-25bd-491a-9c5d-deec154f9b70 =cd09864e-822b-4a1c-89cf-7d0595f11762 =7f613f51-cc4f-4f22-b676-1617535bb0ea
