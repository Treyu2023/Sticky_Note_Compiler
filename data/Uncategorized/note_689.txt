After installing the part, I initiated a cold start on the board. However, the dispenser immediately displayed a vapor vacuum error code (5070), indicating an issue.=ff227cfd-21b2-4900-a757-c61ec15e4927 =b8ec3f09-5b28-40d2-b6ef-a622e9f954c3 Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue:=01d91a73-2793-4c1f-89f6-7eac40836ab0 =c12e7301-96d4-410a-be69-4ae4253af085 Software Adjustments: I updated the Pump Control Node (PCN) software but encountered compatibility issues, necessitating a downgrade to properly upgrade the Local Operator Network System (LONS). After addressing the LONS, I upgraded the PCN software once again.=a4f09b30-d55a-4a18-b0b5-68e49b233ce7 Compatibility Challenges: The door node software was found to be incompatible with the updated PCN version. To rectify this, I upgraded the door node software to ensure compatibility.=02757192-622e-43c1-ad5c-290de63f1b1b Persistent Error Handling: Despite the software updates, the Vapor Vac error persisted. I decided to disable the vapor vacuum function in the programming settings to circumvent this error.=e63b8b13-df3b-4955-81f8-5272f3af9427 Calibration and Testing: Following these adjustments, I calibrated the dispenser and conducted a series of tests to ensure full functionality.=65c1868a-31e7-4f87-a3d0-8aca7cc60e35 Conclusion:=616f0f7e-3fa1-4cc2-a1df-11b3472ee3b5 After a series of complex software upgrades, downgrades, and adjustments, along with hardware installation and calibration, the dispenser was restored to full operational status and placed back in service. All tests confirmed the dispenser was functioning correctly without further errors.=9619a1e2-1997-4fd3-a328-ada03cc773e0 =823529b6-3356-4ab8-9cfc-973c10d970c0 14-14.75 30 miles=adec3a64-4762-483a-a377-bace50e442a3 14.75-15.5=921d4e55-a221-431b-aa86-f32e7fedd303 240425-0048=03dcc85d-c3c8-4be2-992c-d000047ad1ee PO - 69670509=a887599a-c7b1-47da-9429-3587438fa050 Murphy 7420=fd1e0624-df4e-48c5-8347-05a35752b5f9 3470 Parkway Village CIR=9be84f7b-abd5-416f-84a8-b0a7c2ce0229 Winston-Salem NC, 27127=531ed8a3-3aa9-436b-b113-e9809bdba885 =e10ece0d-5645-40c0-8514-452b0c4afe72 Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and proceeded to investigate the status of the sensor that had previously been causing alarm issues.=f5bc78e8-98bc-498e-8f5d-aca1884e7a94 =56d4d122-3e66-4129-9478-106e9a5cc391 Findings:=20953547-9626-407d-926c-14e166c296c3 =997d7fa1-15b9-4dfa-824d-b8d301114570 Alarm Status: I determined that the sensor has not triggered any alarms since our last intervention. This observation led me to conclude that the previous alarms were likely caused by the physical disturbance of removing and reinstalling the sensor, rather than indicating an ongoing issue.=1d129719-72fa-403c-ba63-d442031345d5 Verification: Both the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) system data and confirmations from site attendants corroborated that there have been no active alarms since the last visit.=c790875b-c804-4517-9e18-1e9033aad138 Conclusion:=352e921f-ebd0-4196-98d6-aa92d64955cc The investigation confirmed that there are currently no active issues with the sensor, and the alarm conditions reported were artifacts of maintenance activities rather than indicative of any malfunction. All systems were tested and verified to be operating normally, ensuring the site is functioning as expected without any disruptions.=01217ce7-d683-4ba6-bc5a-bda5211ad2f2 =130abaa7-8ec5-4f78-9882-5bf26146bb7a 15.5-
