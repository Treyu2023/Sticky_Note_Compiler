The Siberia 325M and SP had no power. I checked the plug and tried a separate power supply. I contacted PDI security formerly known as Siberia and troubleshot with them. They are overnighting a replacement to the site on ticket number 2417608. The rep stated that I could obtain a tracking number later today. I will return tomorrow after equipment arrives.=localId_7e63b9b9b3e44284b4ba2f9a36a83a9c =localId_a4869ed352384f5ab686ec1232833323 10.5-11=localId_1ad89f2af5484311b9997a7ac01f4d0a 11 25-12.25=localId_65399b439bd64e1a959f6aa0ed51c331 134040=localId_d1fdec24ef9f4e479200b5568f9ee9f7 FWKD3456720=localId_3491f4e1cbfe406dbee0afba2eb6bb0a 711=localId_aa5c0c0b27de4c24889455dec4abffa8 8010 Southwestern BLVD=localId_5bf51a4e3aa4482fba8e885163e04a85 Dallas=localId_bc6af75939b5416692d26c2117f4739e =localId_967986dfde8d442da36d304f6d74aa91 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.  I went to run the BRCM tool, but the site is not using the home plug portion of the BRCM nor do they have Ssoms installed in the dispensers. This means the tool doesn't apply. The site's 2 wire connections for the dispenser communication had 0 wire nuts installed. so I installed 2 in each dispenser 12 total. Aside from the things I checked, the issue could also be NEC / Dex related. I have yet to witness this issue while on-site so I can only go off of what I am told by the manager. All test ok.=localId_44298f9ec7c74f9792f06b19ed95353d =localId_d7235598c4a6479aad758a88a845aa8e SS12.25-13.25=localId_2d8eadfee3cf487980474f513a96491c 134022=localId_56af2a5d559b4a0385fdcdbd64aa3105 FWKD3446952=localId_41058eda5b5a43e7aedb888a8f043003 Already on-site, I replaced the UX300 Card reader on FP3 and tested with EMV debit at dispenser.
