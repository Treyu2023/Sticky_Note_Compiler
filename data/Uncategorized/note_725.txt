She contacted Abraham regarding the issue, who explained that the problem occurs primarily when changing prices.=6bc43550-06e0-4d52-a3e3-078f26f37733 =79d48c8a-bf64-4847-8fc7-8d1eaebb16f4 The site is running a RUBY2 + CI configuration with Buypass 1.15.40 HPS. Abraham mentioned that sometimes, when editing PLUs in the config client, the system locks up, requiring a reboot.=28ee217f-7ee3-47e0-848b-9a007911bb75 =9c1cd2eb-d8c4-495d-90ee-ddc25cdb1144 Explained that this software and hardware configuration is less than optimal. The new software pushes the older hardware to its limits, particularly when running both the registers and accessing the config client through the register. This strain on system resources, especially during busy times with fuel and card activity, causes the issues they are experiencing.=bba9c487-c8e0-47a3-af44-ef6862f45527 =b465dddf-ae2e-4b06-b319-841dfb426e9a Rebooted the Commander and demonstrated the procedure to the manager, recommending that they perform this reboot at least once a week to free up limited resources from logs and background operations.=a26d0691-6388-432e-a38e-065e443088d1 =772afadf-7401-4ddd-8b61-a463b4f63210 Advised upgrading to a Commander and/or C18 registers. Abraham requested that we inform Hutchens to consider upgrading the site's hardware to a Commander or provide a laptop and (capable) scanner for changing prices and entering PLUs.=fb694324-ce8b-4cae-8dba-00f2f3de8ce7 =d134d429-0f70-4b8e-b250-af3233cc2fe3 Conclusion=3fafbc46-37f2-4a11-b7f4-a229d63b325d The siteâ€™s current hardware configuration is struggling to handle the demands of the new software, leading to lock-ups and performance issues. Rebooting the Commander regularly can help manage the limited system resources, but upgrading the hardware is recommended for a more seamless operation. Abraham has requested that Hutchens be informed about the need for a hardware upgrade or alternative solutions for managing PLUs and prices.=2517ab3f-0cba-4612-9a4f-9c28719ea8eb =43f33332-e5da-47af-aa35-80700832929e =38491184-4c99-4392-88d5-ec4c5dde5bb71-=98664255-20e8-4b9f-b4ad-7b99bf057e96240808-0119=a6941d57-2d07-4611-900a-894e79f4bd26CAP NC0023=2bc72334-ba45-46cc-8d8a-7ca39007e956PO - SA-16260=e52fd6af-aca6-4648-8261-0e64c6f27d0b3028 W Gate City BLVD=9e1e074e-e4a2-4128-8dd7-cab3898b1a96Greensboro NC, 27403=06b814ad-39dc-4281-ad0a-ed247af7321b =77666826-02e9-44ba-946a-504c453d9491 240809-0393=5621555c-5e5c-490f-909c-03e62d1eece4 Circle K 2723788=c2cd0385-2458-480f-8dc4-011d0eb8fa5a PO - FWKD3813536=2a667f87-e687-4a97-84e1-16baa99b13f3 820 N  Main St=b048ccbf-5042-4cbb-9af5-33faa71a8137 High Point=7e80124c-d216-4604-8afd-880aab4d34a8 =9095f637-b218-4bf5-9608-5e8085db1d92 1.15-4.1565 miles (rerouted from HPR call)=439a3429-8516-4462-9c74-08313d24724e 4.15-5.15PM=d53b0b60-a8f7-45ce-8a5e-f4780566a621 5.15- 6.15PM 45 miles drive home=ed1c483c-679f-4e6c-b9c0-d0d78aaa0852 =60d00f64-df49-42bf-8b43-08e1a2f7831d Arrived on-site, checked in with Attendant. I found dispensers 5,6,7 and 8 were showing offline on the CRINDs. I checked into the issue to find that they are communicating with the BRCM the issue is between that equipment and the POS Terminal. I explained this to the manager and my manager contacted Adam with circle K to clear up any discrepencies with this protocol. Adam stated that OWL services typically would have to come for the NCR issue and they would previously had us stay on site with them but now that OWL has bought DBE they are able to have complete coverage. I was instructed to close the ticket and if it is later determined that we are needed they will re-open another ticket for us over the weekend.
