I checked into it and could see that FP 1/2 was online on my end. I reached out to TAC and found out they were not able to see FP 1/2 online either, despite it being online on my end.=1efbc587-2f37-4267-8958-363fc70a17bc =57c0e6b1-ecf0-46c3-9f24-5018c78ea3c6 To resolve this, I de-registered the SSoM with Insite and re-registered it. Notably, this time I had to use a One-Time Password (OTP) from the authenticator app, which was not required the first time. After re-registration and refreshing the server, TAC was now able to see the device.=85fe11b6-fcd4-45fd-b6a5-d083cc41d457 =edc28427-2951-49ba-80fc-739f69b32e77 I reached back out to Tomasello to update CK and awaited the checkout code.=e229c950-fadf-4f9b-9cce-bb20202005d9 =0bf47071-f79a-4ff8-8fc3-33936dc4e593 Conclusion=e8753f89-04eb-4c8f-8042-297a24b7e6ea The site is now 100% compliant with the software and registration criteria laid out in the instruction guide.
