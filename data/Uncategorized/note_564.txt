The issue at hand pertained to the UX300 card reader on Fuel Pump 7, which was unfortunately in a state of tamper, rendering it irreparable.=be41936d-7872-4e9a-ad8a-17330f0cf0b4 =02fce7fc-8b54-48eb-a831-4c4ac417c9fb In light of this, I proceeded to replace the malfunctioning UX300 card reader with a new unit. Following the installation, I conducted an EMV debit transaction test to confirm its functionality. I'm pleased to report that the transaction was successful, indicating that the new card reader is operating as expected. All subsequent tests conducted were satisfactory.=7a174850-2259-4041-8b88-13e0a8eb83ff =f0a29bd2-d183-4b38-8805-53bc95b6a364 FP#7  EN00257683=60c5acbd-fb60-41ae-89a0-7caf8aac534b In - 442-380-317=dc75bbc0-e8e5-46e1-bbe6-ecd74c819dad Out - 442-621-555=0e9dce6f-095a-49d4-baa0-3281385d1197 =b9ed37fa-4e66-4e15-9ecd-a15054d49f5c 10.25-11.5 45 miles=f5b544bd-fb71-4db1-9751-f41e24e00a33 11.5-12.5=f2612c46-3e9f-4f78-be2c-0b0df788cfa8 230705-0240=86287df3-8a12-4071-ae93-bd8160b28133 Checkers=f7e9e8c3-93b1-495c-9328-7cf97f9e1cc9 1905 Academy St=0df6aac0-7406-47af-a9d5-8d4173551344 Madison NC 27025=4d615b11-fb4c-41b0-aca9-404f5bf686d4 =8697fd5d-7ae5-46eb-995d-9da7fa809418 Upon my arrival on-site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty. The reported issue pertained to the Diesel probe, which was failing to register any information with the tank monitor.=57a820dc-010e-46e8-a88a-c4cbc78f84b2 =2445d01b-9354-4d4d-8997-22ef31adec5f To address this, I remade the epoxy pack and meticulously removed the moisture from the connection situated atop the probe. Following these rectifications, the tank monitor began to provide accurate reports for Tank 3, Diesel. I can confirm that all subsequent tests were successful and the system is now functioning optimally.=606d5d8c-7fe4-43b3-afd0-65afe1aea21f =ab578656-37c5-482d-82d7-011d39a91703 =3209be24-7d1c-4f05-af7b-c270a8b5d1c8 12.5-14.5 60 miles rerouted =9ba630b0-5fea-4e5b-b4ef-cea7a596039c 14.5-16.75=3ff7fa44-0d9f-4f20-82a1-95551f3be0d1 16.75-17.75 57 miles=1d2e168e-ab5e-4fe9-a65b-f427e162fa90 230705-0382=5c4421fb-3359-4c32-9a3d-879c9c1f1779 1404 Freeway Dr=d85ef7d0-46ca-4d77-9129-01d61813d183 Freeway Mart=168a2459-4787-402a-9b7d-de88330ef972 Reidsville NC 27320=0449057b-bb79-4a6d-ab1d-670f6f71224b =4de1897a-f14d-440a-8f63-0e6ae4b8621a Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty. Except for Fueling Point #2, all the dispensers were displaying "please pay inside" when I arrived. Initial troubleshooting involved rebooting the dispensers and the Commander, which effectively brought the card readers back online.=19a8a41e-3d95-407c-ab8e-3783e4ca30eb =f80808fb-6422-436a-80a6-c8e3f64ca99d However, the site reported frequent card issues prompting "see cashier" messages and often leading to the locking up of the Card Reader in Dispenser (CRIND). I utilized the BRCM update tool which successfully updated one device. Further investigation revealed that Dispenser 5 and 6 were connected to phase A power, whereas Dispensers 1-4 were connected to phase B.=0ba60ccb-f4fa-41e8-9dd6-5070dd3e16e4 =b3c8a9b5-2659-410c-8e2a-13aedbeee358 Given these findings, I recommended the site hire an electrician to shift all dispensers to a single power phase. I believe this discrepancy in power phase is causing the communication issues, leading to card readers locking up and dropping out during card swipes.=98dc8238-9ce6-4ea8-9aca-ac1138c96147 =25fa49fe-5b99-4f9c-a46e-c8bab6e3d4fc Fueling Point 1's readings were not different but rather reflected the same issue. I demonstrated to the site how to reboot the CRINDs and the Commander, equipping them to handle similar situations in the future. All work was duly completed.=5319a091-52ff-48ca-b122-c8a548370e87 =5c3f4011-dc1e-4b4d-917e-5a4528ed7728 =2ba38333-f6b1-4edd-980f-9f28a34c3bcf =67990cfb-0992-4bf8-8e2f-a11cdb983143 =b942fa51-ffd8-47db-8173-a12a478aea38 =077f4fa5-2c74-4308-abc8-e35326facc2b =247b48da-b4c4-412b-91c2-269aa1fa65e0 =14214b1a-b5b1-41f2-a748-b7ffc319f34e =4cbb7aa3-839c-4b5a-8fbf-a9c68cdb0ef8 =e18b0390-70eb-4a14-9a1a-0a6c0e6d295c =2b8f63c4-6e80-4f50-b033-4a09b409596b =e387a151-b0bb-4b9c-8ef6-91914eb9057a
