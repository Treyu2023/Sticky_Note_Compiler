I went over the programming and checked the configuration of the DMEX bds. I called for a second man and truck for confined space and crowd control. Once David showed up together we openned all the Sumps on the tank pad & found that the B20 tanks are now manifolded together. This was not the case in the ATG so I made appropriate changes. This was to address the sudden loss alarms. Together David and myself accessed the E85 STP Sump and replaced the E85 check valve to address the Gross line fail issue on the ATG. All test ok.
