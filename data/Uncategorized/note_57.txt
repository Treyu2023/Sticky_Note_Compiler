This site did incur losses for both premium and DSL a few weeks back where we had ordered and replaced the pulsers on dispenser 3/4. I checked to make sure they had not been tampered with again. I resealed the dispensers after I checked. I reached out to Austin Hott (with 711) per ticket and shared info about this issue I also coordinated for office to email hi. Any tickets pertaining to this issue in the DFW area.

FP3 Was not displaying the correct prompts or asking to leave card inserted. I rebooted the Dex, power cycle dispenser, purged the crind. I reloaded software on FCB. I contacted Dex-711 swat and worked with rep to try other venues. Ultimately I did not want to get into OT too much on this. I noticed there are different card readers on each side of dispenser HCR 1 on 3 and HCR 2 on 4. Incompleting call for now
