FP #4 (EN00086578) was on an activation screen, I spoke with the manager and she stated that this call is for FP# 11 (EN00086577). She went on to say that FP #4 has had this same activation issue several times in the past month. I investigated FP#4 to find it is the card reader losing activation. I dismounted and remounted the card reader and activated the dismount sensors. Once complete I tested a card successfully. FP #11 CRIND screen is halted on the BIOS with message "fatal error 200". I tried rebooting the UPM, it will need to be replaced and the UPM will have to be ordered due to shortages.=9a84e1f0-5c7b-4b78-8ac6-7d0e17be05b9 =8bffd1e9-1289-4c4e-a364-3b7c528b46cb 11.75-12.5 23 miles=9eab4fb7-6643-4375-ad3c-e116de39927d 12.5-14.5=da641392-674c-4025-b7c1-ed76f3dac173 230223-0141=653a7904-5951-4930-aeee-6308d975e242 PO - 1-5518853572=d36de370-7ed6-49bf-b03d-9b7320ec5441 711 #35574=aff8a0fb-4c27-4629-a841-8953cc5c4f08 4847 Charlotte HWY=978cd5ed-350a-4cdb-88d6-1b7dc58e36b2 Clover=2d49072d-1142-4c27-b6f5-6d7c405010d4 =0734459a-5011-40e6-b942-a044ce06f00b Arrived on-site, checked in with IVR and MOD. I checked the ATG and found that T:1 is showing a leak rate of -0.19 GPH with CSLD testing. I was able to clear the alarm, I visually inspected the vents for damage and checked the fill and vapor recovery for tightness. I reached out to the contact on the ticket (FMS) and explained the situation to them. It appears like this may be a fluke as the site is using CSLD and has a pass from the 21st (two days prior). I had the FMS agent put a note on this site to explain that the alarm has been temporarily cleared, this test runs at mainly at night and may take longer to see if it is in fact an issue.
