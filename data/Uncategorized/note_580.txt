=7be3abab-482b-4227-9c65-89be62535bab      I Ryan Key am a veteran Service Technician in the Petroleum Industry. I have worked most of my career here in NC in the Triad area operating in and around Greensboro, would like to file a formal complaint against my former employer of the last two years. JFPetrogroup (Formerly Jones & Frank) for their involvement in unsafe practices which certainly would have exposed me to chemical hazardous atmosphere conditions without the necessary Equipment to perform the task safely. I terminated my employment with them 2/10/2021 due to unsafe expectations of my employer, I was given no alternative to the job they assigned me that I was comfortably equipped to handle safely. I explained to my boss that Heavy maintenance would be required to make repairs due to the factors of the confined space they wanted me to work in. He was only concerned with company/customer policy which he stated was that since I was the "service technician" on site I was to wait for backup and enter this confined space which was roughly 9 feet deep and contained 15-20 gallons of gasoline. Even after the petroleum would have been extracted by the pump truck they were scheduling, I did not posses a LEL meter to determine if the atmosphere is safe to enter. I did not posses a tripod and harness incase emergency extraction would have been required. I was not comfortable with my former boss (Chris Nieninger - Service Manager for the Charlotte branch of JFPetrogroup) in his ability to asses the situation over the phone or make a decision that would not have put me or other fellow workers at risk. I was left with no choice but to refuse work which lead to my termination of employment with JFPetrogroup on 2/10/2021 after my service manager repeatedly refused to understand my concerns or provide me with a alternative to what I considered myself to be not equipped to handle in a safe manner after learning about the conditions and parameters of this confined space.=67c92786-6915-4ab7-9e40-2fd6b9f97a62 =b271c01c-31fb-4278-9ee4-dcfae327c512 The safety concerns are that =888ba87d-9246-452a-987b-2855534128dd 1 they expected me to wait on site for a pump truck to show up and remove the Petroleum Ethanol mixture from the submersible turbine pump containment SUMP at the Loves truck stop on Trollingwood Rd in Mebane NC after already working 8hrs while not being scheduled on call. Against my wishes.=ed623f11-1fdb-45cf-bc04-d751d7893f45 2 they then expected me to use just my blower to evacuate the vapors from the hole.=2ed882b2-80b4-459e-bde7-c0fc4f789b7e 3 they did not provide a tripod, a harness or a LEL meter. No mention of anything other than a second man (a trainee) to assist me with repairs and a pump truck (subcontractor) to remove the liquid.=f43016a3-2a4f-4595-b739-d1c2ad185980 4 This was all happening at dusk with limited visibility in a very deep confined space. The Regular Unleaded STP containment Sump.=35b1526e-0d59-489d-9d96-d6f1c8695afe =dbd861ae-3d27-4fb9-af67-22a5d9ad4f27 I told my manager that I was not comfortable climbing in that hole or making repairs and that heavy maintenance would have to handle this. This was due to the fact that I was not equipped as a remote technician to handle this confined space work. There is a severe lack of safety equipment for my branch. We have a storage building in my area which is not equipped with any of the fore-mentioned safety equipment. In fact for the entire charlotte branch there's only been one tripod, harness and LEL meter that stays in the charlotte warehouse for the two years I've been back that hasn’t changed that I am aware of. I have conducted work for them for some time now and am aware of their unsafe practices. =bca49d3f-433d-418c-98d8-b9291b1caf04 =0bdc3126-4478-4f17-bbdb-d368a5e16036      I had to make the decision to protect myself when they chose to put their profits and customers before my own safety and well being. I am filing this complaint because I don't want to see someone else get hurt knowing that I could have said something to prevent it. I don't dislike the people I work with I know they’re all just trying to provide for themselves and their families. but they cant really do that if they are ignoring safety concerns which are eventually going to cost lives, there’s a severe lack of experience in the branch I was working for and its only getting worse. If someone doesn't stop these unsafe practices its only a matter of time before some unfortunate employee suffers from their negligence. Only due to inexperience and poor decisions coming from management/customer corporate policies which neglect proper safety measures and promote cutting corners when dealing with hazardous situations that hinder their profits. What they are actually doing is  jeopardizing their employees safety for profit.=0e4b9dc7-c452-419d-9ed9-c04aee3ce70f =bc581b0c-7ef7-40bd-a084-f8c54eab05d4 My Contact Information                                                                                  My former Employers contact information=468ebd80-853a-443f-a17d-d031ae00788d Ryan Key                                                                                                             6701 Northpark Blvd # B, Charlotte, NC 28216=34b646db-5634-4b53-871b-05d7a2965115 6471A Bethel Church Rd=81a78a57-e5a4-468b-83b0-413ed2e5a5d9 Gibsonville, NC 27249                                                                                       704-393-8618=aa5c963d-1597-42b6-9bb1-ac5bf4d4147d =f97a3f45-64ea-4b2f-9b68-9895e85fc0d4 972-877-1848=1b0e61ee-3f31-4b35-8cce-fb443865a603 Rkey20069@gmail.com=74c7b9ec-bab5-497b-8230-788c6d08e947 =9c574457-d4c5-4fe4-885f-4c43c6aefc8f Site where unsafe work was asked of me=03081d6d-17a8-4e23-a964-d1dbf64c9bf9 217 Trollingwood Hawflds Rd, Mebane, NC 27302.
