Hooked a monitor up to the site server to find it was running normally with no issues. I rebooted for goo dmeasure and the boot process seemed fine aswell. I traced out cables and found an ethernet cabel that was not plugged into anything I routed this to the Site controller and the Server offline message went away. We were then able to successfully test cards. I contacted RTSS and they were able to sign in and sign off on my ticket.

I reviewed the previouse ticket with the manager and it showed me theft played a part last time. I witnessed a customer fueling on FP2 Diesel. This position was the only one that had been tampered with. I asked him to stop fueling when I noticed what was happening and he stated that he did not speak english. I then shut off the shear valve to the diesel product. The customer immediately hung up the nozzle got in his truck and left. He showed he knew what was happening. I explained this to the manager so she could keep an eye out for his truck. The pulser was tampered with and missing parts and is also part of a set so I couldn't replace just the one pulser but had to replace the set of 2. We then checked calibration. DM and Myself changed both Diesel dispensers level 1 PIN to XXXX.
