Subsequently, I proceeded to initiate the necessary measures, which included taking backup copies and capturing system images. An automated upgrade was executed for the Commander and Topaz systems.=600ad794-93e6-4a15-a3b8-bf69761ef1ff =f785740f-16cb-48a6-9e37-28537650a6dd However, it was later discovered that the dispensers were not the issue but rather a malfunctioning audible speaker on the newly replaced Topaz register. I promptly notified the administrative team of the issue, and they took immediate action to provide a replacement unit under warranty. Upon consulting with the customer, it was decided to replace the Commander as well.=6e65c244-b258-4d8c-81ca-4c8bdcd186d3 =7c7010b5-1ff5-4d51-a451-46f5f8edc49d Following my conversation with the administrative team, I was able to acquire the necessary parts from the shop and proceed to install the Commander and the Topaz registers on-site. All necessary testing was successfully carried out to ensure the systems were functioning correctly.=36648559-f3ca-432d-8f1f-96abb596a845 =89510115-6925-420e-b40e-1215925ce95b =9ad1ccec-b19e-45d5-a1e9-b176c8ca2c28 =a0dd8873-d7b1-403e-9330-088eac2c3a97 =5669f9cf-d6ce-451d-bb29-121acf4ec362
