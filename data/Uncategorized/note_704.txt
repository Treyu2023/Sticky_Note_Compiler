I found that the issue with receipts on the dispenser was missing screens DCR download fixed this issue. The address on receipts was programmed correctly but when we swapped out the commander and blew the backup bakc into it I forgot to repeate this. Making the ecessary changes corrected this issue. I turned off the cash back option and I turned on the loyalty as it was disabled. Afterwards I reconfigured the app on my phone to test and attempted to test loyalty at the pump but this site is not showing up on the list of sites within the APP. I am unsure if this is cause the site just opened or because it is not set up on their end but either way after the changes I made I would like to return in a couple of days to see if things auto update or if we have to contact them on this. ALl work complete at this time, will need to return to check loyalty. Placing ticket in hold other status pending Loyalty test transactions.=dc5e5489-e73a-484e-a412-35fcecc73dcd =06bdbed7-b3c1-457a-bee6-8b7daad3ae48 =58483163-f5a4-48bc-8645-3d66be829da9 =d03a2f3a-87f6-4e1b-883f-c97ac41f66ab
