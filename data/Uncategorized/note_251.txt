Diesel STP 2 we replaced the Yoke ASSY and the Plug connector on the receiving end of the yoke due to electrical fire damage. We also replaced the 25Âµ Capacitor. Afterwards we tested the operation of the dispenser/motor.

On arrival several f the dispensers were displaying CRIND BIOS on the card reader displays but only one side of each dispenser was down. I checked the primary graphics side setting and it checked out fine. I rebooted the CI which took a very long time before we could use the register, like 25 minutes. normally only takes 10-15 minutes. I ran the BRCM update tool and diagnostics to check field wiring. One device was updated and the routing rule was updated. All of the field wiring looked good in the diagnostics. The issue is really the CI is dying. I explained this to Syed and pulled a backup from the CI and gave Syed a copy to keep on site. I instructed him to reboot the CI once a week to try to prevent this issue. and to reboot it in the event the issue returns. I tested a few fueling positions previously down.
