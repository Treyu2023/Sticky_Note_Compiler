After gaining access, I performed a visual examination of Fuel Pump (FP) #4 and did not observe any discernible malfunctions with the dispenser. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive testing of the mid-grade fuel and engaged in communication with the attendant. Furthermore, I was able to successfully establish a connection between the Passport register and the dispenser without any complications. All tests yielded positive results, indicating that the equipment is in good working order.=cd0f5fed-84d1-4902-95cd-485c5cecb068 =4bfc064d-b252-4614-89d8-ddfdf008b8ca =b3086cad-bd52-4e0c-a3b6-017be9e12d0a 10.5-10.75 15 miles=1e803779-0a68-4552-b587-a5d0e8ee34b8 10.75-11.5=4a9215ac-0f66-4fab-8801-69b5aaaa5619 230317-0245=f52cd6f4-a7c0-44f0-bacd-50864ac0c77a PO - 1-5540347132=a4bc0120-fb5d-48e3-b5df-1b1494249938 711 # 36068=c05506a1-5f06-4293-af9a-d66e77952a4a 1005 S Main St=b320bbf0-2768-4138-b886-ceee57100b39 Kernersville=7fd5cb45-a84f-4d13-aa89-466229d99660 =17f50569-c13c-45f2-8be2-1417e961cc49 Upon arriving on-site, I utilized the Vixxo mobile application to check-in and also communicated with the MOD (Manager on Duty) as a professional courtesy. Subsequently, I conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and determined that the 2W cable within the dispenser was inadequately secured and loose, leading to the cables being entangled and pulling on each other. I promptly resolved the issue by properly securing the cables, and performed a series of tests to ensure that the issue had been completely resolved, all of which yielded successful results.=32a17aae-4bdf-459d-8720-0d08b00b4e3f =d139e99d-4bd1-499b-9618-1e2572f3d3d3 11.5-12.5 55 miles=5eb633e8-9f12-4c8f-869b-9c038400ec7a 12.5-=9d31f8ce-833c-46a7-abfc-f83d81dae47d 230308-0210=06f73998-30ea-4414-bdd9-536f85028cd7 Randleman Rd Valero=45bb08fb-37ac-4a45-8c67-5ad36efa6ffd 2400 Randleman Rd=e93e66c0-8121-445f-9929-2b523b0e342e Greensboro=ff927ffc-ebb4-44b3-b836-56f1907e47a3 GVRID 828952=0b50e60b-8db6-424c-88a9-10286363fbb9 UDS2,WFG1,WFG2,USD1,NBS3,RBS1,BAM2,PAY2,PAY1,HPS1,PAY3=0eb8f27c-42e3-457a-845b-e9a0085da3e2 =45697471-90fe-4d72-b10a-741ff709ab34 Upon arrival at the site, I proceeded to check in with the MOD. I then proceeded to perform troubleshooting steps, which included dismounting and remounting the FCB, and reseating the video cables. However, despite these efforts, the issue persisted so I replaced the FCB. I encountered difficulty in determining the hostkey for Valero, as the other side of the dispenser was not displaying this information, and the health report did not include it for FlexPay2.=7e2683e5-5f43-4edc-aa01-dd221c77415d =b1442421-403d-4a47-9098-313aebd8b489 After engaging in discussions with the administrator and consulting with other technicians, I attempted to resolve the issue by rebooting the FCB and trying the USD2 key once again. Fortunately, the key worked this time, and all subsequent tests yielded satisfactory results.=b1bd7d03-9382-4abf-8e99-5692011b5331 =94e84283-8fc4-4f40-b393-ac7863743068 =31ddaeb8-968a-4026-a75e-241fa2388f38 =f3da673b-d5e6-4c8a-82a7-2c72489a7a8f
