The manager explained that there were issues with 5/6/12 and that no dispensers were printing receipts. FP 5 & 12 were working. FP 6 had 5150 error code in PPU's. I removed the PPU Tray and Bd for 88 Grade. I cleaned oxidation from the board and tested it before re-installing all components. (had to re-activate the UX300 since it has to be removed to access the PPU Tray.) FP 11 was showing please pay inside. I was able to warm start this dispenser and that restored communications. All but two printers at the site had paper jams, one of those two was out of paper. The reason for this is that the thermal paper the site is choosing to use it too thin for spec and will cause jamming. If changes aren't made this will eventually damage the printers from the paper jams wrapping the rollers until they are so thick they bend the shafts. I informed the manager of this and advised the site against using this paper. All test ok.=121442b2-5a86-4a4a-bbc2-10da743592e0 =e31bbe4a-ff92-4401-b29e-d247b7a2aab1 =968fed30-622c-47c9-907f-ee403cd148ab =82f85a32-edfa-4ca1-8645-ee9139403917***=3243aa88-be2e-4bcc-93a2-926b9b4a9099Daily stop BRCM commissioning number 11478243=0a4b0ebf-52ae-4740-b51b-adf31daa2306***=ff9cf0b8-a0ed-4b70-90de-8e6abb2d757c =11077a2f-2bb8-4352-b2fe-1c34b30b8a3512.5 - 13 RTT=fb7d26de-049f-49b5-bde9-408d35b6ddee13 - 17RTL=56d69df0-a117-44b0-96cc-f016bb86ef2417 - 18 RTTDH=90c16b4a-1fa0-45b4-858b-bf8bda0c59d3=0676d190-ad5d-426b-a9a4-c31e6870797eVMS - 130035 =ce72a064-a5d5-483d-87eb-84de75eade9ePO - 179560200=8bc0b13c-9d8a-49df-af2a-257b0fbbdf7b =51e71843-2e8b-4744-9c8f-554f6afc4553RT 2337=f6304e94-764d-4b83-9f27-3a8cc8c6b6d72807 W Northwest HWY=ddb102bc-8b3e-4df8-b87a-b20a3445d1e0Dallas=4528a5e2-702f-45b3-966c-d47263dad1ab =2f168a7c-23e4-4006-b260-9c2181690a6a =9cb2ac82-6008-48bb-b686-f603961e189c Filter change for entire site.=a946d7f6-8883-4e50-9e88-55af6c137019 40 filters total=795d91ff-9db5-4fe4-bfc1-4e93109e75a3 400MB-30=27e013fe-1c22-4361-9ab6-cf2172a16bd7 X 20=372f6a3b-8b53-425a-bbc4-ba791eb6f169 400-30=eb213bb9-c54c-4421-ae88-cba394d4f6a1 X 10=84529fe0-7489-43e8-ad75-857884037145 400HA-01=ed83a287-2bea-4b66-97cf-8a8562afc87f X 10=cf0e75ed-c926-42d6-be3e-be73f63c6800 40 X disposal fee.=6724efc1-8bbb-43f7-95a5-4f39d55c73df =1d715a2c-e7cf-4949-aab3-342e49778f85 FP 11 has stripped manifold on the Regular grade and will need to be replaced before changing filters again,
