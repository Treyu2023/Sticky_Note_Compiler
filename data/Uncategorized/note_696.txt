I reset the password for them to what they requested "SAM7777" Additioonally I set up their security questions so they can correct this issue themselves should it occur in again in the future.=565e34fd-76cc-44c7-8e8f-f7b81abe6ac2 =68f590b0-f1fa-4421-a001-10d068fff196 11.75-12.5 45 miles=c92149dd-cb19-450d-a87c-f646b1088eb7 12.5-13=c0a4eb7c-7ccf-474f-a697-c2ec4a84092c 240508-0170=1f99b63d-33ca-4b66-a692-bde7c265f8ca PO - 69776177=d426337d-8f82-4f13-895d-0774f1160c23 Murphy oil 7420=bacbfe3b-cd9d-4a8e-ba68-cb0d7112bd38 3470 Parkway Village CIR=0cf90a7c-67c3-4f29-b1c7-7354e0f158b1 Winston NC, 27127=25b12f5c-817d-4a5e-b9c9-b194e37e80f9 =58005be8-8b20-45ea-a98d-96bcf9921a0f Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and verified my presence through the Verisae IVR system. My primary task was to address concerns regarding what appeared to be improperly positioned equipment related to the tank sensor.=c49a1c6e-80ac-486e-b79c-75765683f522 =6375d9a3-e34f-4eeb-9d8e-ac19445cdcee Investigation and Actions Taken:=d1a81725-efd4-4edf-85f5-1e2c0eff29d1 =dbbd09c2-39b7-4e0e-ba97-4cc17db91c4c Sensor Examination: I identified that the issue stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the sensor installation. The sensor in question is designed to wrap around the tank, necessitating a long pull cable for installation and removal. The visible cable in the riser, which had caused confusion, was merely the excess part of this pull cable, not an indication of improper installation.=100a0c96-2bae-4eb2-b8ac-53838d854697 Clarification and Documentation: I took detailed photos to demonstrate the correct positioning of the sensor and the purpose of the visible cable. This was important to clarify the situation to the site manager, who was unaware of the reasons behind the recurring service calls.=325ba3a8-7af5-45cd-aaf1-f2082ece239a Communication with Dispatch: I forwarded the photographs and an explanation to dispatch. This action aimed to inform whoever was initiating these service tickets about the actual setup, thereby preventing future unnecessary service calls related to this sensor.=d1caa40a-4e3a-4c4c-8f09-64768929ca97 Conclusion:=b8af78b1-d7df-485b-bb17-cab0bf89b8c1 The sensor is installed correctly under the tank, and the visible cable is a necessary part of the sensorâ€™s installation apparatus, not an indication of any issue. By documenting and communicating these findings effectively, I hope to prevent further confusion and ensure that all parties understand the setup. This clarification should assist in managing future maintenance calls more effectively, focusing resources only where genuinely needed.=975694ea-13fa-48e5-8142-3d5986ce2d2c =3dcb467a-a690-4739-929a-0b9dd5bb0bf5 13-13.75 28 miles=5130a203-a4fe-43db-b86c-eee38722fbbf 13.75-=3199ac3d-2e3c-46c0-8711-bc5264b54746 240508-0166=c912a1c8-3907-46b9-8924-2628f8a99d3a PO - Genie=ded01369-f7d3-4bc1-b060-a0f81420585c SAMS Express Car Wash=1df7ee16-f894-4027-9f54-95f64818b3d1 4965 University Parkway=9d4af8e9-6d46-4b32-ab18-024b95926cb0 Winston NC, 27106=97220bec-58f1-40a0-85e2-74e3fc253eb1 =a09f4281-3a42-4812-a156-076d90de9581 Arrived on-site, gathered serial information from dispenser 7&8 (EN00003331) and diagnosed condition to get replacement parts. I spoke with the site to ensure they understand that the screen has been damaged by force and is not a warranty covered issue before gettin the replacement parts. Additionally when I checked the warranty of the dispenser ended 8/31/2020. The manager would like to replace the components. It appears that the screen is damaged and the Door node 5 (M12803A007) is messed up as wel. I will need to get replacement parts for both as I do not have either stocked on my van at this time. Once I returned I installed both parts without issue but the dispenser did not come back online before rebooting the EDH. Afterwards I was able to ensure the components worked as expected. All test ok.=88f33cd8-e4c6-49e0-b4fc-38f16524965b =0275abb1-98e0-452e-a1c1-b6740c0fca1d =a6bdea4f-11e4-4975-8f65-898d164757f7 =7274d271-ca03-4e94-b769-3e8c798631f1
