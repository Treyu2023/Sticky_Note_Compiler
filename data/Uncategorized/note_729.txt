Register 2 was unresponsive due to a power loss. After restoring power, I discovered that the site had turned it off for some reason, and the screen was unresponsive to touch, preventing any login or interaction with the register.=b202eb8f-f64a-4c86-9168-6ac83e9ea68a =b493aabe-19ea-4873-87f5-a8bc73d51e97 I reloaded the software on the register and re-paired it with the POS system, which restored its functionality.=0eed8edf-fadd-4702-931d-b753c0cc6df6 =a7d56b81-23c5-405d-8aa7-3434cf46b6e0 Additionally, Fuel Point 4 (FP4) had lost activation. The GVR app initially experienced issues, but once it became responsive, I was able to re-activate the UPM, bringing dispenser 4 back online. I tested the card reader on dispenser 4 and cleared a printer jam. All tests passed successfully.=687c655a-3207-439b-9ab3-ad3b0f7c3122 =01f1981c-6561-45b7-82f7-86d5e5918932 =f307fb98-d8c4-46fa-b7ce-065a88e42975 12-12.30 15 miles=a4db6f2c-7f7d-4c4e-bd66-132904ca3266 12.30-1.45=11eab2ca-3898-4093-a11c-8c9236392320 1.45-2.15=4aaa027e-2592-4cff-8d11-8e14b51aa597 PO - 285878294=99b98880-bcae-4178-923c-a1ba4df1bb46 Refuel 1118=3ce37e34-2b73-419b-adfb-f6883d3ff49e 728 N Church St=fbb063fe-4101-4796-a741-38c314da6eab Burlington NC 27217=068f777b-5008-4811-b1a0-a97cac0bf47d =ee56dee7-d692-43ba-8e90-c95c23511bf8 Upon arrival, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD), who reported an issue with Fuel Point 10 (FP10) not dispensing fuel. I tested both premium and regular grades in separate transactions, and both operated normally, so I unbagged the dispenser.=31380c64-0d8e-49cf-9af2-2a8ed8a308c1 =e5c011fe-6841-4f98-8e3f-33563d160371 I then addressed the issue with Fuel Point 11 (FP11), which was displaying error code 20 in the Price Per Unit (PPU) for premium and midgrade, indicating a disconnect of the premium pulser. This type of error typically requires clearance by a Gilbarco Authorized Service Technician (AST), I inspected for signs of tampering, but the void stickers were intact, and I found no evidence of tampering. I cleared the error and put the dispenser in standalone mode to conduct a fuel test with a transaction of $0.63. I intentionally left the transaction uncleared so that it would push inside, helping to diagnose any potential sale/buffer issues. After confirming the POS was working and FP11 was back online, I tested the fueling process again. During this test, I noticed the nozzle was leaking steadily, so I replaced it.=d810ebf0-d95a-4e5c-b0cb-f53ea22685e6 =0673377c-a7c3-47c3-8b64-6e7f2b0931fb If the issue recurs, I recommend replacing the proportion valve. Currently, FP11 is functioning properly with the new nozzle installed.=1c0f9a6e-bc9a-416e-9ef9-f33e8938ce5b =15b5cd80-46a8-4a9d-8862-8197122292af The MOD also mentioned ongoing network issues where the same card fails to work outside but succeeds inside. I advised the MOD to collect specific transaction details, including the time and the last four digits of the card number, to provide to their network support team. I informed the MOD that I could not make any changes to the card tables and suggested they reach out to their network provider for further investigation.=578a209c-7032-49c4-b2c3-c61f2e41c003 =ba60b545-e675-4ed1-a50d-6cb72711d6d9 All work has been completed, and all tests passed successfully.=e3f828c8-f2f0-488b-996e-6e1a82ab9b29 =44eeab90-2667-44c1-a511-546a2bbdc517 2.15-2.30   15 miles=5a9db882-99c7-43ee-8883-652c37b3f0dd Oil Change=5d67a8c4-f05e-45dc-9b0e-5818cb674a41 =82dd57a2-ca7e-43bf-b451-4f45fcb5c2fd 2.30-3.30 50 miles=512e6212-662f-4bbe-9b02-2c1bc36cfcab 3.30-5.30=c5c05595-255e-4458-adb2-e393185e4a88 240815-0319=bd3d8d5b-2381-4533-9656-fe76c0ed39a4 Stop and Save Mart=63857368-9576-4e0b-bae0-ace319db25d3 6641 Styers Ferry Rd=fdb098fb-6fe9-4d13-b512-080a69333126 Clemmons NC 27012=aa2fc9c4-a7a1-4b7e-b654-6cec22690f39 =e1aed02f-479e-4e1e-b787-96b0fad239df Arrived on-site to find the one skid tank diesel dispenser is bagged and has all zeroes on the displays even for the price. I spoke with the attendant and informed him of the COD status. I looked into the issue and spoke again with the attendant to find they had power loss a few days ago and the dispenser is losing its programming. The customer declined the ordering of part and stated that they would call us back if the problem returns. All test ok.=3f9e72a2-c60c-4358-b7d9-cd1ecc9c7562 =3a1d919b-b288-471c-a44f-0ce08b06b6f9 =76c6e2ef-513e-4a88-80dd-2f323ce3b2f5 =66ae943c-b2eb-4eeb-8314-e83b9a81f50c open the back side of the dispenser head using your CH751 key, press F1 on the Keypad press 2 2 2 2 enter=3b3312f4-5503-4519-8be9-cd94cdfd576d press 1 2 enter press 1 5 0 3 enter press 1 2 enter ***hit enter once or twice until the 7 is flashing press 5 enter press F1 press 1 7 Enter press 1 3 0 9 enter 1 7 enter then press enter once or twice until the 0 is flashing (should stay a 1 on the left) change the zero on the right to a 1. press F1 press 1 3 enter press enter untill the first digit of the 2 2 2 2 is flashing in the Price per gallon window put in 4 numbers and write them down this will be used to access the dispenser so not just anyone can get into it. These direstons will also restore operations until we can get back out here and replace the logic board with a new board/battery. a power loss is likely the reason that it lost its programming
