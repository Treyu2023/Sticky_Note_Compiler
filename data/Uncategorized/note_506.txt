I replaced the C+ meter on FP 3 Non-Ethenol.  Once Andrew arrived, he and I calibrated both 3 & 4 Non-Ethenol.

We troubleshot the motor issue and found the wires on the Capacitor in the FE Petro Housing had shorted to the lid when it was tightened this caused one of the three wires to burn in two. We replaced all 3 of the connections on the capacitor installing new ends on the cable and cleaned debris out of the bottom to allow for clearance when closing the lid. Tested operatioin of the motor now each leg is pulling 4Ω before they were pulling 1.3Ω. This corrected the under run condition.

I tested 7/8 and 9/10 to see exactly what was going on with them. Each Position worked on the pre-pays but I did have some hose jumps on each one. The manager said they have been bagged for a week give or take. I also spoke in detail with the manager to get what information I could. It appears the site has a history of mechanical leak detector issues and they have had recent power interuptions. I unbagged all but 9/10 which Had communication issues. This way some customers could use 5,7 & 8 while I monitored them and work on 9/10. The GSoM for FP 9 was not communicating. The PIP3 on 10 had red lights on it but everything was communicating. The dispenser 2W and Z Modem connections were down, The PCN lights look good aside from no RX/TX. I updated the SSoM and UPM software on both 9/10. I then rebooted the EDH from the register. Afterwards still had same issues with 9/10 I replaced the GSoM and Z Modem cable both of these cleared up the issues in the SSoM, but still stuck on starting app and no dispenser communication. The UPM for SIde B is bad even though it is communicating its causing the red lights on the PIP3 and taking down dispenser communiications. When I leave it unplugged FP 9 will come up. Will need to return with a UPM. FP's 5,7 & 8 are all working. FP 9 is up but I am leaving it bagged since 10 is causing issues. Will return with parts.=eb6475fd-4fb6-45d7-8402-c173c70e4911 =e100eff0-0f14-460b-ac83-47844b4eef08 =ae299e25-677b-4271-8184-5a04bb5d5096 =003b9eae-1f99-4132-bbbc-17b196bf7a2e =32a8e548-2e00-47e8-9e4a-c504a5b211db
