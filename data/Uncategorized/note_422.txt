FP 8 was afflicted by the gate lock defect. I replaced the CR and activated it. I had to purge the crind afterwards oddly. Once the correct prompt displayed I was able to test an EMV Dwbit transaction at the dispenser.

I opened dispenser 5 from the register & tested fueling MID grade from the dispenser to test both products. Based on the ticket notes I suspect the problem was communication to the POS in nature. It had been resolved already, but the dispenser was closed on register and bagged at the dispenser. I placed back in service.

The site was able to clear the open circuit error before we Arrived. We ran a line test from the ATG which re-enabled the line. We untagged the dispensers and monitored fueling operations for a short time before checking the electrical components pertaining to the E-Stop circuitry. I could not isolate any issues due to the intermittent nature of the problem. I think we should isolate each of the e stop circuits independently in intervals to rule each of them out. Currently the site is 100% operational.
