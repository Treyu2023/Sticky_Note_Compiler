I started by repairing the breakaway on FP 8 (gas hose) I was unable to reconnect the 3/4" breakaway so I had to replace it with another OPW reconnectable. I spoke with the attendant and he contacted his english speaking cohort via the phone so we could discuss in detail all the issues and associated costs since this is a COD site. I troubleshot and replaced the UPM on FP 10 (EN00132953) it had color streaks on the screen and after rebooting, it came to a tamper BIOS screen (see attached Pic) so replacement was the only option. I loaded the same software and hostkey as the other side of the dispenser UDS2 hostkey and 52.12.47 software (PCI 5 compliant). after a secure device update I was able to run an EMV Debit transaction. I troubleshot the CR on FP 2 and could not clear the amber light at all. I installed a UX300 off my truck and it came up with a solid Red light DOA. At this point I reinstalled their old CR and when it came online  the amber light state was cleared. I activated and tested and it is now working I can not explain why this occurred I am unsure but maybe leaving it unplugged for 30 minutes did the trick. Anyways no return visit is required. The site asked that I look at the printer door on FP8 I disassembled the lock and cleaned what I can only describe as soda from the lock. I then re-assebled and it is also now working.=a09e6507-80dc-4fab-9581-d0b3c12fd29f =27d517be-a289-47a4-bfe0-65a462a7f70b =51894234-80e3-4054-b10c-f514162f6998 =6e0ae042-8233-4c2a-973a-8235a11a2ce6 =b218e97f-0348-42c9-b4f8-00b4098387c5 =7a542819-7f6e-4100-b97c-69b91539e9fb =63ab2996-761e-4033-9495-5aae5b230652
