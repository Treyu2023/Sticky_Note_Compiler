Subsequently, I proceeded to examine the settings in the commander and reached out to both Citgo and Verifone for further assistance.=95be09af-98cd-42ca-bf64-5556b0987015 =696823b3-1b3e-4b82-a9cd-1bb19718f1a7 Following communication with both parties and conducting a transaction test, I discovered that the signature prompt was indeed being initiated, but the screen calibration appeared to be inaccurate. My investigation of the PIN Pad settings revealed no calibration options, only diagnostic tools. However, during the signature diagnostics, I was able to use the pen without any issues, which led me to conclude that the problem was software-related rather than hardware-based.=a81a603b-da4a-45f9-a3b7-5fa981c5d6b3 =0f5239fc-e2fe-4ed5-9105-ab45647db13b To address the issue, I carefully followed the manual's instructions and correctly installed the software according to the matrix for VAPS software loading kernel 702 software. I then reloaded the remaining packages and initialized EMV. The subsequent testing of both contact and contactless EMV cards proved successful, and the signature prompt is now fully functional. All tests were completed successfully.=8d85e30a-6a30-4c06-85f8-e0c478ddcecc =317124ac-2ed0-472c-bb6c-2d0a36965df5 =484dc761-60bd-4d34-9d76-078dbfcaf0ca =ee2fcd2f-1ded-4109-805e-1ef70473c97c =3f3d518b-b965-499a-b82c-d2f89a9ced8a cbl132-003-01-A=8860ec44-8e50-442d-8e49-8b57479bdde2 =5bf8dae8-e2e2-4bf9-a91b-f4f4e0f3a4b4 13-14.5 70 miles=8ba167c8-87b9-4e9c-970f-02899f801b75 14.5-15.25=f2678d5a-1329-4c58-8d53-a2f436599a2f 15.25-16 30 miles=6f95e736-3668-47fd-b2a0-a4eefd12e96d 230411-0236=d9c384e1-f2f0-45ce-96cd-ed1ff1af8681 PO - FWKD1629510=a0728237-bf97-48a3-a28d-c11e93814005 Circle K=6f3f82e3-9fac-4b6d-b9f1-1c192ea4b5cf 801 E Harden St=210291d4-6baa-4840-b8f9-652b7cd4077e =96841aee-e253-4ec3-94cd-0fc704fdf9fa Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). I proceeded to replace the nozzle on Fuel Pump 7 (FP7) for the high-flow diesel dispenser. I noticed that Fuel Pump 10 (FP10) had three bags covering the nozzle, but the reason for this was unknown. After consulting with the manager, I conducted a thorough examination and test of the dispenser, which operated without any issues. Consequently, I removed the three unidentified bags from the nozzle on FP10. I also tested fueling on FP7 after replacing the nozzle and inspected for any leaks. All tests were conducted successfully and yielded satisfactory results.
