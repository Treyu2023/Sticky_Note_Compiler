I checked all the settings on the CRINDs for both 9 and 10. I found that one side was set for Generic 2W configuration. I changed it to MOC for passport. Once I did both sides started downloading from POS. Once downloads completed dispenser took prices and the CRINDs returned to a normal state. I was able to test an EMV Debit transaction successfully.
