During my inspection, I discovered two Comm cards that were partially installed in the TLS 350. After plugging in the Lantronix card, the system began cycling through a warm start, which necessitated restoring archives from the system menu and re-enabling the lines before the site could dispense fuel again. I then proceeded to the Charlotte branch to retrieve a replacement card and returned to install it. Upon installation, the system stabilized and allowed me to configure the card. However, when I attempted to test the card with James Anderson from Han Dee Hugo, he was able to connect to the card but could not retrieve any information from it. Furthermore, resetting the Veeder Root resulted in the system cycling through the warm start once again, which required me to restore archives again. Consequently, I contacted the parts department and ordered an ECPU-1 board and a motherboard (backplane) for the TLS-350. Unfortunately, none were available locally, so we had to order them, with an estimated earliest return of Thursday or Friday. I am currently on hold with the parts department.=d72afa59-4aaa-4e0a-8b6a-f2b155c0beb4 =677a8319-80aa-4980-ace0-348e002c3757 bisco=9df970c9-f608-4229-9205-98b766006f7a =37345fb4-74b1-4e7b-b9b4-d2e02e74b07d 13.5-15 55 miles=2088a877-3a08-4076-8a44-dd79f771e4b6 15-16.5=4dc85ce5-6f62-45fb-be15-22f0edfac67a 16.5-17.5 45 miles=290d8cee-c102-4af3-8d6f-9ab53e4742e7 =1fc05332-0061-42fa-81c3-35da19edf2a6 QC # 3=f0c73faf-1b5d-4938-af2c-b918bdc270ce 511 E Main St4=1f75a3b2-9d55-4bdf-aa41-f2da5292396b Bisco=44cec898-8384-4667-9036-aba15d795cda =59db5fbc-f551-41d0-b6f7-bc2149a3f9f8 Upon arrival at the site, I duly checked in with the MOD (Manager on Duty) and proceeded to investigate the reported card reader issue. Following a comprehensive troubleshooting exercise, which included a system reboot, it came to light that the PIN pads had been inadvertently swapped to different registers. After rectifying this issue, I conducted a transaction test, alongside some necessary cable shortening to optimize the setup. I subsequently conducted an EMV debit transaction, which was successfully completed without any further issues=localId_83699aa36f1242f79ebb2a0fba4fed9b =localId_d005b797a6114b0bb1e9981e32c3387d =02a06136-b794-4584-8323-c423a81da2a5 =a5bbff55-02a8-41bb-8258-bd13bb8c6802 =1df2eaf8-b6d2-4f1e-98ad-7b07b1389d80 =e1453b6f-b2e6-4397-84ac-7ac8616bc9a0 =724ab22f-e5cd-4291-86ff-90f4435ef558 =4321f9ec-3078-4b90-9665-cb5639d9f80b =c9449803-2bfa-4fcd-ba7d-853d7fb65061 =f32b6a68-4456-4e0f-b1aa-1e49e2416b37 =7f9872fb-a006-4b6a-ad2d-361cd15a56cf =34aefe48-8a0e-403a-99a7-5c67c3457ee2 =23143415-4f15-449e-8e46-87925ffd1c44 192.168.233.240 IP of lantronix device=60300350-aec1-4e93-ace9-9821f9f7eac5 255.255.255.0=722f7e13-6c31-4e7a-b911-45f88cfe7d52 192.168.233.2564 gateway=81995a46-fb9a-4d1d-a2c0-74e39db9fdac james anderson=1f0d6b8b-3feb-4ac0-ab0f-a978ae11ca7c =c34fc4d3-f531-4c45-af0c-5b9913454bd3 101 lawton rd
