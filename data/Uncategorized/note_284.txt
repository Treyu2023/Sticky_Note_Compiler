To resolve this, I replaced the Hybrid Card Reader (HCR), activated it, and conducted tests which confirmed its proper functioning. Serial details for the HCR are as follows: Serial Information=45ec7a70-7e7f-434b-a235-4de7a8d45c1d DSN - EN249665=305e6365-0ad3-4e22-bca7-63f313b781cf CRI - 5431303831303232=8d31045f-384f-4acd-b62f-db4358e4ca67 CRO - 9916A0200410130F=b914697e-2962-4242-9cad-266e1f80ab7a =306c4b6d-4784-4389-a350-a47cfcf1d257 10.75-11.25 15 miles=8624293d-afc2-409e-ab13-4d402f09aeb6 11.25-12.75=9b806e37-e1b2-406f-a4c0-17f55ce52f0c 230816-0182=6bf289ab-aef6-40cf-b8e2-422e8405e77b Gas N Go=c071bd40-4c9d-4add-a94d-6242fe5b4310 1526 N Fayetteville St=5d4d3f8d-0e30-4ddd-8a97-26f7b6f3d5aa Asheboro NC, 27203=389a332b-7861-4f21-abac-d85f3c1ab1d3 =003f5144-5f57-4d45-9172-00fd3f4188e0 Upon arrival, I consulted with the site manager and Muhammad over the phone about issues with Diesel dispenser 11/12. After testing the dispenser in standalone mode, no issues were observed. The manager described additional irregularities with other dispensers, such as sales being dropped or relayed back inside. While discussing this, I noticed the Commander unexpectedly began reloading all the DCRs. I rebooted the Commander and advised the site to regularly reboot it to prevent such issues. It's suspected that a customer's payment dropping due to the observed circumstances might have caused the reported problem. If these issues persist, I recommend upgrading the site's Commander to base 53+. All tests ok.=9aaea2ce-6477-4327-82b5-6dc2cb78f742 =9ed5c3cc-139a-4002-9faf-4fff8456c230 1526 n fayetteville st=064a11c5-87ae-45d0-8db5-5df30e1c3166 =d80a2d15-18f4-4bfc-ac87-eb5ed132b1c4 7203122875=c52e02c8-1823-42dc-a537-409cf8725603 =8405ac53-65c7-4384-84a8-4eca4cebbd2d 12.75-13.25 25 miles=2ab36ae4-9328-4e56-84dd-a5ec3ae98db2 13.25-13.5=95162516-88a3-4844-bcfb-0551d2b0144e 230807-0367=45cccb49-07a4-4e83-8ea2-34acc84e25b0 Gastown=d5f83a77-008d-40bc-a740-ce9ba0c7a20e 1409 South Elm Eugeen ST=d5fe72d0-baee-44e8-bafb-b5b0228a1f4c Greensboro NC, 27406=1e4cafe2-9b11-47fc-8089-a421fa6f204f =c7db4dfd-13e9-4938-a1d4-65d49e66148b I arrived on-site and spoke with the MOD, who was unfamiliar with the reported issue and couldn't reach the owner for clarification. I briefed her on potential problems that might arise and resolve on their own and advised her on what signs to look out for if the problem recurs. For preventive measures, I recommended a weekly reboot of the Commander. Everything tested satisfactory. According to the dates on the ticket this was called in 9 days ago. Closing ticket.

A complaint from a customer led to an NCDWM agent emphasizing that providing two conflicting receipts for a single transaction was unacceptable. Discussions with both the 711 help desk and Fiscal Systems clarified that the Fiscal register doesn't auto-update its prices in tandem with 711. Instead, managers need to manually adjust Fiscal's prices to match 711's updates. However, the site isn't alerted when these changes occur. The onus of resolving this communication gap lies between 711 and the franchisee location. Given that the equipment is functioning correctly, this isn't an issue for Guardian or other service providers. I am closing the ticket as all equipment is working as intended.=7bc46700-ad1a-4365-b373-ff8718b8cadf =3048a2ee-1054-4260-874d-4afd65d63708 =6b325500-765b-4381-85ab-176f7fa2294a =c4daa409-a99e-418f-9cfb-9d663b79f14f =af02db84-52c2-4765-ad21-0fa4bff9a16d
