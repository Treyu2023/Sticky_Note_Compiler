Spoke with the manager and investigated issues with Register 2 printer and R3 Coin dispenser. to find that the printer was at fault and I replaced it. The coin dispenser on R3 had a loose power cable after I traced this out and repaired it, cycling power to the Coin dispenser I then teted it successfully. The manager had mentioned Apple Pay not working on all three registers. I was not here for this so I looked into it briefly but did not spend too much time before concluding this is a Shell/Wincor Issue.
