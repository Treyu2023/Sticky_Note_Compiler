The site was disrupted by a power outtage. Once power was restored, the register did not load up completely. I was able to restore the register and network functions. When testing fueling I found that the Veeder root was without power and both the Regular and Premium Isotrol boards had been blown. Ed Lylles was working on the veeder root and stated that he would finish that part. I got with parts about getting a couple of isotrol box replacements. Went to shop to get the parts and returned. Once I returned I installed the two Isotrol boards and tested fuel. All test ok. The customer had some issues with the POS. I got contactless working inside and turned off handle up calling. The relays from the isotrol boxes may or may not be bad I removeed them and set them on top of the installed boxes in the store incase they could use them in the future.
