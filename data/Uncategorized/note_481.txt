Davis and I collaborated to inspect the dispenser, noting that both printer doors had been changed and the locks were missing. The site expressed a preference to order and install the necessary parts independently. By bypassing the printer door switches, we were able to clear the alarm. Still, we identified a problem with the ADA keypad on Fuel Pump 12. The site will address this particular issue as part of their parts replacement initiative. As of my departure, both the dispenser and card reader were functional. All tests were successfully completed without any further issues.=5529cbea-833e-4429-b5b7-386319c6c213 =af4401e2-fb2b-4f56-b54f-49b4b7736e19 13-14 62 miles=81681e7f-7e03-4f1b-a34d-48be20eb00d4 14.25-14.75=013b6360-ab28-4bd0-ae39-72462cca2c7a 14.75-17.25 131 miles=788fd6f0-53d5-4e62-84f5-aeacf4044154 230803-0386=25e732e7-f09c-4266-ab43-76ab3c82c586 Fast Phils #145=c98fe4a8-2f96-4ea5-963a-3b9e329c8a31 2443 W NC HWY 10=f93d0159-3e76-445a-99d3-4f7ad0ff8565 Newton NC, 28658=998e78e8-0e03-4521-bce9-dca68cf3bc9b =951c0e3a-72e5-425c-a09a-0d0278118d46 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.
