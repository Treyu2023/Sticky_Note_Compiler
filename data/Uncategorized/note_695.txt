This time I requested that my backup meet me at the location so that we could pull the motor and figure out if theres an issue with the equipment. While I waited on david to arrive I removed the electrical panel covers and checked the phasing of the Veeder root equipment paying close attention to the PLLD power breaker which is a single pole single slot double throw switch. I reinstalled his old isotrol relay because it was not having any issues, please note that I am unable to remove the part from the ticket myself as its already been assigned and synced. the part was allocated to my (1766) truck (NC2211). Once david arrived we attempted to pull the STP motor to inspect it and found the yoke im pretty sure was already broken cause we never moved it from its original position and we took upmost care trying to remove it. Neither of us had a Yoke on our trucks and the site is already open an hour later then they usual for us to finish. I informed the manager that we would have to return in the morning.
