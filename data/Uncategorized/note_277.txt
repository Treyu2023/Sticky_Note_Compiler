My investigation focused on the ATG (Automatic Tank Gauge) alarms, aiming to identify the source of the issue. Contrary to initial assumptions, the problem did not stem from tank 3 (designated as "Regular"), but rather from Liquid sensor 3, which corresponds to the Premium tank.=feecb332-25bd-4ab2-8097-ecee59cc9556 =9036378b-265b-4702-9ac6-65e361cb1e31 During the course of my inspection, I detected the presence of approximately 50-75 gallons of water in the sump. This critical finding warranted immediate attention, and I promptly brought it to the manager's awareness. Once we established a shared understanding of the situation, the manager took the initiative to contact the maintenance team, who subsequently arranged for the water's removal.=6ef2d8a7-db32-4513-8cb0-cd2989289136 =7d283f03-2d0a-4f90-8a92-225076e53150 Furthermore, I strongly advised the management to engage the services of a qualified professional, such as Guardian or any other reputable entity of their choice, to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the STP Sump. This diligent step would help identify the root cause of the leak and ensure a thorough resolution.=f458561a-dd86-432d-8e94-af5edb78ec0b =f864d595-e8ce-456e-baa7-4bf94250f1f8 Consequently, considering the completion of the assigned tasks, I am currently closing the ticket. =a1cb7f41-88e0-4199-ade0-1f3e367fc1b5 =8a05e945-a2a7-4fdc-8760-320ac4226090 12.5-14   41+38 miles (79)=a571614f-1cae-4b21-9165-6a982bf3cb33 14-15.75=7f55fde4-cad3-438d-99ba-c343af79a787 15.75-16.5 25 miles=ca559564-be81-4bba-8537-62a3fd26d349 230519-0154=8322c3f8-43dc-474c-9b5d-b66c1f4c7786 Econo Mart #2=21b8cb06-7a7f-476f-8884-86c7dbf28f80 1140 HWY 64 W=0a9dd401-f956-4e97-9cf9-faeb209b88fb Asheboro NC 27203=ac844058-3de9-4648-b58a-ca14377871a8 =fe9b7722-544e-44bf-b674-46f6e5dde245 I visited the shop to acquire the necessary part for the task at hand. Upon arriving at the site, I promptly checked in with the MOD (Manager on Duty) to provide an update on my activities. My primary objective involved installing the valve isolation kit (M07685K500) in the master dispenser (FP12) and ensuring the wiring connections to the Tokheim satellite were correctly established before energizing the system.=d5c5b6bf-45ef-4149-8891-02af4fda76d6 =e48f6269-a9cf-40ba-b1a3-f2ae273b6633 In addition, as per the manager's request, I replaced the Auto Diesel nozzle on the master dispenser with a high-flow variant. Subsequently, I conducted comprehensive tests on both the master and satellite dispensers, assessing the fueling process under varying flow rates, namely fast and slow.=fca2d1ec-44bf-4273-86c7-8c0c4cbc4218 =431879ea-b692-48fc-8df1-d10431577b4b I am pleased to report that the system no longer exhibits any issues related to overrunning Pre Pays, thus indicating successful resolution of the problem.
