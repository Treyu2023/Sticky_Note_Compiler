Fuel and CATS were offline when I arrived. I rebooted the Commander as instructed. This made no change. I then troubleshot to the FCI box and replaced the RS-232 board and was then ab0le to reboot the dispensers/commander and move the channels on the RS-422 CAT board. This restored communications and allowed me to run a debit transaction with loyalty outside. All test ok. =d9802599-b476-41e2-ba48-a4d9dba8b767 =7633591e-f8c7-45a2-8639-0b362a1ba75310.5 - 11.5 RTL=436839ed-c8bc-448d-90bc-277f90c58fb0=eda7bbe5-d22b-4151-a7ea-3952843cb4a2VMS - 130611 - INCOMPLETE - SUB=47fcb40a-2170-40b3-abc5-c9309f46cf71PO - 60603518=b96adc6a-a71a-4fa9-8871-2a52fa17f93c =a4f5a459-2651-4940-8882-10f4019c41e7 While on-site EZ mart Compliance specialist showed up and pulled a sample from the tank which I then used to determine the amount of water/phase seaparation in the tank was 4.5 inches. I informed dispatch of these findings and they worked to schedule a VAC truck to come out, unfortunately this wont be until later this evening so I shut off the breaker for the Premium STP and had the site put up signs on the dispensers showing only 87 octane is available for now.

I waited for the VAC truck to get there and worked to prep the site for his arrival. I worked with the Subcontractor to remove water from the Premium tank and STP sump. Afterwards we ran a test from dispenser 2. I dispensed 5 gallons without inhibited flow through already installed 10 micron filters. Luckily it appears it did not get into the lines.

The dispensers were powered up when I arrived. When speaking with the manager and afterwards I was able to coroborate my theoretical diagnosis to the E-stop triggered PLLD on just the lines that were in use at the time power shutdown and the ATG remaining powered up causes the line tests to fail on the low pressure lines only. No alarms currently on the ATG and the PLLD alarm history showed exactly what I described. I explained this to the manager.
