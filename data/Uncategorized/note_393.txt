Site has Eco Meters so it is not likely that theft occured. The bottom door was not secured and the electronics cabinet latch was bent in a way consistent with forced entry. I was able to fix the latch, bottom door and lower lock. This corrected all damage to the dispenser. I tested fueling from dispenser.
