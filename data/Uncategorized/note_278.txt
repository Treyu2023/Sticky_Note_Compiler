The site is describing that sometimes when a customer uses their card at the dispenser, the receipt can not be found on the passport. I looked at the system before contacting GVR TAC. I also ran a transaction for reference. Gilbarco informed me that the site doesn't have an active service agreement, they did however assist me with starting the TLS monitor service which corrected the issue. Additionally I reloaded the CRIND on FP2 and cleared a 20.00 sale from the register. I ran BRCM tool & diagnostics from laptop to troubleshoot intermittent offline issues. The BRCM tool did update the master SSoM & the duagnostics showed 2W connection is good at the time of testing. All test ok.=localId_d5e0bcdca7704650ab56098044fe61f5 =localId_0b304c8ea01046babef28417aac5a346 =localId_25af6e9e9cd8477698d9ec81bf2169ce 13.5-14.5=localId_c826c775388145e2a609ef4630d3935c 14.5-17.25=localId_aee0e829c5e847a381f47f0880c8e3fa 17.25-17.75 rttdh=localId_2765c6aca3f648c2a627b3e5547b554d No VMS=localId_bea13ce803084025a9f24a25cf58da64 204603347=localId_79c5feda429947bcb55971a5a201dc99 RT=localId_78dcd30b5a414d90ab06dc481c35a80f 2921 Western Center BLVD=localId_069cfe70ce184b5ebf3a9ae2e9b98340 Ft Worth=localId_4d312a5985bb4616958cf03712f216b7 =localId_119cf0617c3343f6848ada38c4fda04c Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  The mag VFC for Q1 was in error displaying "LU" (locked rotor). I called for second man to access the confined space.
