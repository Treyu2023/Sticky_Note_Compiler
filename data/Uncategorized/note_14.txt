Initially, the manager was unable to locate their Commander password and requested that I reset it. However, I discovered that their ASM agreement had expired in 2019. After identifying alternative resources, the manager eventually located the password.=b518c5ed-b66d-4383-9104-66a6445ec496 =3d6d9551-76e2-488e-9488-28cef659a33e Subsequently, I proceeded to shut down the forecourt and initiate the system upgrade. Upon completion, I made minor adjustments to the Commander settings, which allowed the SiteConnector and Connector Switch to come online with the correct IP addresses. This brought the site into compliance with Exxon EM+ Reward standards.=7de73fb6-96d1-4da9-a28d-7ebcff9c06d6 =cdc2e931-b097-4f78-8836-0aa18d2e91ae During the database restoration phase of the upgrade, there was a brief power outage at the site and in the surrounding area. Fortunately, it appears that the outage did not have any negative impact on the upgrade process.=973e60c8-d04d-446c-b2ae-c2fccb5abf88 all test ok.=6ecc7264-fd42-4073-a33b-ef8b98fb6398 =e3b47f97-bde1-4bac-8c5b-7912cead542e =50fee9ef-7de8-4a6f-9851-d53849f3166d =c9a6a1c0-0780-4b57-a9f2-bf9c5eeb9179 =99c95665-d974-44b7-8580-13d56aca5599 =eabb1c52-4b25-44dd-979a-f044852c05f8 =6d50b646-ea2c-488a-95e8-1ab2cf5cfc16 =12ce611d-02f5-4d9d-be7b-1a57eb27e090 =54059ecb-1871-4478-8c72-18fa592acfe2 =7ac6ae76-f8c1-4434-86a0-5c2b42a003bd =5343b94e-90ac-4e3a-8c4b-b628a5746e19
