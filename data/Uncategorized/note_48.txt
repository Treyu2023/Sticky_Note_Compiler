In addition to the shift reports configuration yesterday unknown to us the store close setting for AEOD was activated with the default time of 11:59 PM. This was not in scope of work I made correction peri made correction. Site is to manually close at 6 AM. The information did not automatically pull to the back office last night, comma likely because of the time difference. Even though the site would not let me perform a shift close yesterday. This procedure was working. This in fact makes this scope of work different and this call is not a recall. 711 helped us release me while they were helping the manager manually enter the info. All test OK.=74ff646d-037c-455b-9da1-d71bc3cfd7f1 VMS#132326/132326 continued=860d9775-2c5e-4ef5-9534-5ac0c17ea1a2 711=dc97b82f-f296-4d40-944f-1048f4fd5002 10690 Walnut Hill Lane =03bffcb5-6a65-4610-9039-5b9b35d10fba Dallas=1128c712-48e0-498d-a797-ae8eb80d76b4 PO:  FWKD3159045=62048338-2d57-459d-9c2f-324afb8a16dd =46e98fd5-4026-4945-b675-25599755305b Arrived on site, checked in on SN and with MOD.  The manager stated that the only issue is when the POS displays an "O" on this position.  When we respond and have the 711 DEX reset their box it corrects the issue.  This communication issue only effects side of this despenser.  It was not down or bagged.  When I arrived I provided the manager with the phone number to have the DEX box reset.  I cold started the CRIND Logic boards for GP after watching customers use it and testing transaction with my card.  I watched several other customers use it afterward.  Not once did I see the problem occur.  I contacted 711 Swat-DEX and explained what was going on and the rep discussed with his supervisor and then told me they would follow up wih a technician.  Call to see if more can be done.  I waited for 15 min as asked and then had to leave the site.  This conversation doesn't require that I be on site.  All test ok.=c228cf68-70bb-4c3e-82aa-8d6cf6c8849f Before leaving, another call came in for the same issue.  The POS had grayed out only position #2.  I went outside and it looked like FP#2 CRIND was rebooting.  #1 remained up and working ruling out printer/CRIND Reg issue.  So then I replaced just the CRIND Logic on FP#2.  It came online without having to reboot the DEX box.=76978b7a-1336-4826-87ff-b62642cc6edd =f2d0ad95-1fbd-4ca1-9249-c91558327c95 3-5:45 RTT=localId_5a98e78babcd44589cd32f80e8803ba0 =localId_861a16fb2e1b4a3d98f89ad747ea6b09 645pm rttdh=localId_4df468275b0448c599b7588248190162 =localId_f103457679db4b68acd2c299f3ac2d25 =localId_36efc5ba0a45493da05fa58d1be463a8 =localId_dc39e4a23d0a42188bd5bdc4812874aa ON CALL=localId_4782fed41e53404eaf51c56c3d4ad859 =localId_c50dec55b34a406584da8c515faca16d 20 - 21 OTL=localId_5ae5e21ff2eb4c8690f61678bcd9ceed 21 - 22 OTL=localId_80de9f9cb7b04d37a42eedf874d3abc4 22 - 23 OTTDH=localId_c0c28fa72a644398a9c1a4c3c4375533 =localId_fbbfac7f1d0841348e69ec6eb2031536 2223 S BECKLEY=localId_ff9b220359ef4cdab5442438aa8d8957  DALLAS =localId_99ffcaff58c64edf94030432b16d0837 =localId_1bf6325624844a5f9db28877b6d567fe FWKD3160071 =localId_e680e18cbfe94cb4a3e57f943df0b450 =localId_4e9f4101b60843d8b939215714c5f2a4 NOT ACCEPTING CREDIT.

The network was showing online on the passport, the manager stated that It goes up-and-down. The Siberia has a flashing red light on status A  [primary Internet].  I traced out the cable to AT&T Box in the back with DSL connection which looks down. I informed the manager that the issue is with their ISP provided equipment. All work complete.
