The Veeder Root shows where it ran a test earlier with the running pressure at 30psi, then the seating pressure dropped to 5psi. This site has recently had the check valve and all the seals replaced in the motor housing. I checked both hook signals coming from the 4 diesel fueling positions to rule out them not turning on the motor. I ran several tests from the ATG without any of them failing. I explained to the site that this can also be a symptom of debris getting into the check valve housing. The next step qould be to have the tank inspected/cleaned of any debris and/or algae. I explained this to the manager as well as how to run the test and put directions on this procedure on the front of the ATG. All test ok.
