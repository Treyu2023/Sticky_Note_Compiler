The attendant on duty was not aware of any reported issues or service calls regarding this dispenser.=3fc42712-9931-4dfb-86df-6ac270c0b711 =1071d6c3-65fe-4ce0-a667-acf6b7f4d983 Actions Undertaken:=e880bca5-3741-4e6c-8264-82460c60890b =214aa292-fde5-4002-904e-3a5fbc90c723 Transaction Test: Conducted an EMV Debit transaction test to confirm the functionality of the card reader, which was successful.=d1e25ff0-9162-42c7-a470-6fa53c54f41e =cf86ae43-cb98-4a0b-9e84-5c090d34ed3d Connectivity Check: Connected to the dispenser to verify its communication with Insite 360 and assess any connectivity issues.=cf5a569c-909f-4dc7-b0a7-760967837e25 =50220191-fe1b-4790-87da-7d2609bbe70f Printer Maintenance: Addressed and cleared a paper jam in the printer associated with FP 11.=98fc5c9c-7eca-46c1-ac4e-441a294e540b =8dd4e4ae-8a48-4a3c-a8ea-7b9e219f0b37 Consultation with Guardian Connect: Reached out to Guardian Connect for further insights into the reported issue.

The successful replacement and subsequent tests ensured the dispenser was fully operational, however the error was still showing with Guardian Connect. They had me purge the dispenser and after taking a download I was told they are going to escalate this issue to GVR because they suspect something with the site profile is causing the issue.

The attendant highlighted a persistent "POP COMM" error on Register 2 attributed to recent adverse weather conditions. Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the unavailability of the tap-to-pay feature at several fuel positions outside, with only 3 positions reportedly active.=588ea800-ec93-499a-ac55-e661cd482c80 =c545fd66-9240-4016-a6aa-d587474403aa Key Actions and Resolutions:=00040ec0-0f97-4661-a444-c0acc3b67a7c =d69c022d-ab87-43d8-876f-b9eeb7b8cd7b Register 2 Error: Initiated a reboot of the PIN Pad at Register 2 to resolve the "POP COMM" error.
