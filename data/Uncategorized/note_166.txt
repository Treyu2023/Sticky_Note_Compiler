I tried making a USB and loading the applause mini server. after a few failed attempts I remade the USB using a different image file I downloaded today. After this too did not work I called GVR Applause and Chung agreed that the hard drive was likely dead. I went to the shop and grabbed a replacement Mini server and returned to install it. I found that it was doing the same thing, so I remade the thumb drive again this time using an 8gb thumb drive and the software load worked as intended. The original USB i think was 64GB which made the machine unable to read or use it. Afterwards I was able to configure applause and get it working on the dispenser and register the site with Insite360. I contacted Guardian connect and verified they could see the site is live. All test ok.=8e081bd6-6699-46a2-a506-2658ad78d791 =11400a68-2df4-4043-aab1-d577a2218321 =57422e65-c295-4ee0-8331-e4b40306256f =880d25eb-bee8-4abe-b76d-fd3c185ff172 =1314d1d4-91fd-4315-ac91-537268155317 =b036f9cd-2ec6-4cc5-9ac3-a3e1a747dd33
