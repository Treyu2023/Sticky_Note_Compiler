I swapped the card readers inside between register 1 and 2 per the owner. I troubleshot and attempted repairs on the UX300 CR for FP 4 before I wound up having to replace it anyways.

I investigated the issue with the ATG tank test alarm to find the leak rate to be -0.05 GPH well within the tolerance T2 and T3 were also in tolerance and passing with all functions normal on the screen. This prompted me to speak with the owner over the phone and he explained that hutchens came out and has been troubleshooting this issue and the last thign they have done is disable the manifold and close the ball valve. I explained that the troubleshooting steps they have done tells me that he likely does have a leak in the manifold line. The owner stated that he would get back in touch with hutchens and see how they want to proceed with testing/repairs.
