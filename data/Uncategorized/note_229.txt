After some discussion I found the issue was with the Battery backup on the Truck Side POS. We collectively decided to remove and replace it with a surge suppressor. I inquired about the COM Data Trend R job and found the site is trying to install a MNSP on the TrendR. I gathered info and attached to ticket from system for Admin team to review. I spoke in depth with Lila and they are trying to do scanning at the site, they already  have scanner installed but wanted training with manipulating the PLU's prices and departments. I asked that they get their trainee and a laptop ready so when we return and install the MNSP we can get them making backups and configuring their PLU's. I scheduled for next week with the office.
