I installed The new PIN Pad on Register 1 and tested card transactions. The Pin Pad took several downloads before operational. All test ok.=4ae97d8e-82be-4bf1-8777-3235e8f7d5e1 =2cb3f753-684e-4e79-95b0-0007b71d5077 11.5-12=99612ab1-d2f8-41f8-87e4-534573b09a72 12-=4dc0ae72-4ba2-4613-9f35-bc4bd503e9a4 230713-0120=d7be1d3c-59eb-40c5-b987-d34a41043abb Sheetz#492=33d6ffa2-ceba-460c-873b-846f96876855 1138 South Main St=99db1c34-62ba-4a88-983b-388d5e50b4c3 Graham NC, 27253=1e140591-5526-45c7-9e9e-e77a39fbe25b =cd4133c9-a77b-46ef-80c5-7a570428ed83 Upon arrival on-site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty. The L13 T4 Diesel system was reported to have triggered six alarms on the 21st. Unfortunately, the alarm system does not differentiate whether the Brine level is too high or too low; it merely indicates an alarm.=7cd38bb1-70dc-4b00-8ee2-631605c0f72d =12534fbd-18e0-4a46-b558-a22369db0ce7 Upon inspecting the system, I found that the brine levels did appear to be slightly high. To mitigate this issue, I lowered the brine levels and took down relevant information regarding the sensor. If the alarms continue to occur, I recommend replacing the sensor (794380-303).=fe107793-9c0f-446b-9e9e-2259a22f72a8 =f03692a2-aeca-49b1-a255-8368d05875dc As of now, the alarm condition has been cleared and the brine level has been adjusted. We are currently in a monitoring phase, awaiting changes in conditions to determine whether the adjustments have been successful. All tests carried out post-adjustment were successful.=4a8291db-e22c-4941-b1e2-14eef8b4cb81 =46da3968-4abf-4a4a-bf24-bada7f986f9f =ae5822c8-5ebb-4057-84eb-0666a6d5b63e =908153b9-394e-4e7e-9a7d-b2b45495d17e =559aa05b-7a51-4345-964a-042550bc8851 =29bd505b-2948-46d8-b3ec-7d89177eb204 =9feedbfa-c5d2-4efc-b58f-5e79726eba89 =8a8ec370-e0aa-4751-9862-ae0bbbb95f43 =70c3df6b-086b-4ce4-8977-72e601c5e5ca =c9503147-1e09-49f5-9e15-fdd7f1ee0ce4
