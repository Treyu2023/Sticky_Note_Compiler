I checked the PIP, which had normal indicator lights, and I also adjusted the cables. The issue may have been caused by a loose cable, but this cannot be confirmed without further observation.

FP 4's screen issue was temporarily resolved with a reboot and cable adjustments, but the underlying cause remains undetermined.
