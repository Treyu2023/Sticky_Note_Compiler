FP 6 looks like a new nozzle and swivel was instaled recently. I could see where it has leaked from the oil stains but could not duplicate anything substantial. I tightened the fittings on this position and tested for leaks. Dispenser 19/20 a customer pulled up and allowed me to test the flow rate of both Regular and Diesel products. The flow rates were normal when tested. The customer was a regular and told me of frequent slow flow issues on both of the Diesel dispensers 19/20 and 3/4. The site had low fuel alarm for their Diesel tank but they showed 27 inches roughly 1050 gallons. All 5 of the MAG VFC's were set to Mechanical leak detection, but they were all showing on the EVO as PLLD. I made adjustments to the jumper settings on all of the MAG VFC's and power cycled them. I tried to bump up the running pressure on the Diesel. I was unable to and also noticed that the Diesel has 3 phase power incoming to the MAG VFC, but its single phase leaving it. This makes me think theres not a variable speed motor attached. This could have something to do with the running speed issue since the system is not designed for this operation. The site should repllace the MAG VFC with a STP/SCI box.=efed825d-4e12-48ff-95d4-cd75955a5bee =d05f29d7-a0c4-47a5-9017-feb7507c84ee =f08e9c91-9814-4f8a-9c19-9109e764b35a =c24ebcf4-c60e-4ec0-b689-acc6783d5d91 =61c4ab9e-5763-4083-9968-33c280881e93 =9dc1ed24-7cb9-45c2-ad2b-8dbe1b644ce2 =f10fb1f4-a472-4f7b-9b2b-9d08cff37fd4 =10fab5db-cd53-4560-8961-a5f8f754f157  The screen on FP 3 was showing PIN Pad unavailable. I noticed and cleaned some corossion off of the display and SPM circuitry.  The SPM will need to be ordered and replaced, gathered information for order. =4eeb2c5c-83b3-4c0f-aa48-d7e8a05a7ac8 =90cb7edc-071c-4c58-aaed-488570d2ac37 Model - B23/4220D6/2LNTX/BR =62b1d6ec-3a13-4069-8599-4e0339692051 Serial - 70747C  D15=24391e7f-5463-4a5c-82d7-a54933b856b7 =41a2d67e-3412-411b-a20b-fec287afe31c =6e133ee0-0b41-4642-af8c-805f92077299 =8b5c174b-65bd-4dff-8db6-04d265d0457d 12.25 - 14.25 RTT=d1c2e478-a5e2-4670-80bc-26b5df1907ff 14.25 - 16.5 RTL=localId_7eced19918c949cea251b4f81254514d 16.5 - 16.75 Rtl DH=7e5abaf9-5ce8-4996-8927-d650483fc536 =a7d37ace-ae9b-4d15-9885-385f560c2ec9 VMS - 130548=389143e8-7adf-4522-87ce-b1a69302c0a0 PO - 60534538=70cf20bb-f72e-4ad3-b92a-1de6f3ffc59d =39463be5-c6d3-4e19-a32d-1f813d5e1a37 Murphys 2050 HWY 78=2911fcd4-dc3b-4057-b5e8-14148ca53897 Wylie=f229cf9a-3e4b-4228-9ba8-424e6592db04 =91a13fe7-0f87-4745-a56c-8f8ea40937b3 Arrived on-site and had some issues checking into Verisae so my checkin time reflects roughly 15 minutes behind. After discussing with the MOD She explained that variouse cards are not working. I went to purge the CRIND to try and get a fresh download from the POS and eventually I was able to but it did not want to read my test card (Non-EMV) and the second or third time it did. I tried cleaning the CR out with the GVR tools. I connected laptop to the CRIND and tried to reload the UPM software, nothing seemed to work I will need to order a UX300 CR for this position. The UX300 Card reader is not seeing that a card is inserted making it dificult to detect NON-EMV cards. the problem is getting worse so I had the site make a sign for this position until we can get it replaced.=75394a03-6a12-42be-9cba-2737e52c60a4 =3e856e05-601f-4d7e-82d9-6593762090ac Bruton rd site for tomorrow.
