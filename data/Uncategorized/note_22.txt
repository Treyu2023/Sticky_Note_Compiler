He explained the issues. I ran the BRCM update tool from the BRCM. It updated all 5 devices. This should address the Pay Inside issue. He asked that I make configuration changes to remove the cash receipts and one touch claiming of tickets. There was an incident where a drive off occured over the weekend after hours. I could not duplicate this condition or contact the network about it because we have no receipt from the original transaction. Its likely that the BRCM update will correct this issue. FP 2 was not taking debit. The RKL was correct. I RKL'd it again for good measure. I purged the CRIND on FP 2 aswell and this cleared up the Debit issue. The customer asked that I make a few changes to his touch screen which I did. All test ok.=95a8ee22-5270-439f-a501-2c07cbb93274 =ad372186-978f-4c25-9d0b-caf2e7987096 T12.25-14.25  98 miles=1ff3b571-473f-4b6a-9bb2-4b81d370e310 14.25-17.25 Training Passportrecertification=da21ca99-440a-4e69-8e4e-805df01760ac =1014440e-714d-4346-af8b-d56c21ba121a =02b9673f-1313-44ff-8949-dea735a08228 =592e5060-ce45-4b76-ba5b-55b391cb36c6 =e2eaff4d-f53e-40b5-91d9-c2864a4e84ff =a9e34cf1-b804-4c81-8e51-6862b60fcec2
