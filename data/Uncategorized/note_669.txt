I checked in with the manager and then I power cycled the CRIND it returned the same error. I re-assigned the IP to the card reader  and power cycled the dispenser again this time it returned to a normal working state. Sometimes when the equipment loses power or goes offline the card reader can fail to sync, when this happens it just means there was a delay in one or more of the components on startup.
