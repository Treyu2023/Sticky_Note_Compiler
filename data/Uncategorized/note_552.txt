I followed instructions to enable mobile payment on the P97 network. The site's UPS was an alarm and shut down while rebooting the EDH. This caused issues with the network and dispensers and took a while to resolve After all configuration was completed I still could not get mobile payment online. After several conversations with GVR, 711 and Hughes it turns out the site needs to be upgraded to version 20 and incorporate the already in place MNSP before the P97 network will work correctly.
