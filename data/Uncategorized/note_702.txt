When I arrived the line was not in failure and the positions were not bagged. I have previously provided the site with instructions on how to clear this though so I am not surprised to find it in a working state.=44f08099-4204-4f36-81ab-137e4061ecf2 =1c8d752e-efaa-4aba-8dfe-46a5af4040a2 Investigation and Actions Taken:=bf410828-9a3d-4a91-84d6-5531286c3f57 =dbc4ed2f-2a9a-4493-b103-8c8301f94e72 Component Inspection and Replacement: In an effort to delve deeper into the issue, I opened, cleaned, and replaced the FE Petro Check Valve type R on the Diesel Submersible Turbine Pump (STP). This step was aimed at eliminating potential mechanical failures or blockages that could contribute to the line failures.=062a1456-5ac4-4fa0-a3ff-fdc937a7d8c0 Fuel Quality Assessment: I also conducted a fuel sample test from the Diesel tank. The results showed a small amount of water and debris, but the fuel was generally cleaner than anticipated, especially considering the condition of the check valve.=96a6498b-b82e-40da-9c16-e2a77e325c7c Historical Data Review: A thorough examination of the history logs on the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) revealed that Gross Line failures occurred sporadically, about once every two weeks, with no consistent pattern in terms of timing throughout the day. This irregularity suggests that contamination intermittently passing through the system could be influencing the failures.=c651f68a-16f5-4d7a-a2e5-3bd7ec660991 Additional Check During Site Visit: Before concluding my visit, I reviewed previous ticket notes which prompted me to inspect the Shear Valve Arm on FP#2 Premium. I verified that the missing part noted in prior observations has been successfully replaced, ensuring the integrity of this component.=1ae096dd-1dd8-4185-ad2b-2ee54432ade5 Conclusion:=905ad5f4-4c50-4f11-8d66-7b273260763e All interventions and observations during this visit confirmed the proper functioning of the replaced components and the relatively clean state of the fuel, despite minor contaminants. While the exact cause of the intermittent Gross Line failures remains elusive, the actions taken have ensured that all mechanical components are in optimal condition, potentially reducing the frequency or severity of future issues. The site continues to operate under close observation to monitor any further occurrences, with all key components now verified as intact and functional.=2b01e061-41d7-4d45-8b28-c8c5cb90e5aa =db54ae7c-7a59-4202-a236-8d35a075b082 13-13.5 25 miles=9767a1a9-7184-42cd-a8e6-5b5ef8474e84 13.5-=7eca4a32-3836-465d-8feb-f93ccf9282a1 240502-0261=efcb9036-ecf5-4115-b4d2-b3f8e33d1c63 Gas Town=7b65967a-acd3-495a-a37d-de2cfaec19ea 913 West Main St=4875a6e5-5723-411a-b4df-7009238b82b2 Mayodan NC, 27027=549a96da-5ee7-4237-8d0f-2388d680ea19 =010b4bdc-afd7-43a6-9398-7de7fcd08e2f Upon arrival, I checked in with the manager who briefed me on the current situation. My initial task involved gathering and analyzing data from the Incon Tank Monitor, specifically focusing on historical and recent probe issues.=11503e17-00c0-4e90-8fa3-840671a5e799 =1d3e094e-f36a-497d-bdd7-463eb7e4653f Investigation and Findings:=ab236f05-6fa5-445a-a7fa-e04d3f44ff06 =efc31793-c8c9-4e9e-85dc-5fc07dd46cb4 Tank Probe Issues: The probe in Tank 4 had been recently replaced following multiple alarms, the most recent on 4/19/24, indicating its prior malfunction. Similar intermittent issues are beginning to surface with the probe in Tank 2.=50989abd-41db-47ad-98e1-fb67c1d6bed8 Inventory and Compliance Concerns: Current inventory levels in Tank 4 are significantly low at 128.7/2000, translating to 6.435%. Additionally, the tank scald report for Tank 4 reveals that the qualifying limit for operation is 10%, underscoring potential compliance issues.=319b46bd-0473-46c1-9b2b-39c6fed4d2e5 Discussion with Stakeholders:=e76f6580-ab99-47bf-bee2-e01dbe3b56f6 =4214e845-5743-4a9a-90e3-c1a48aa99a3e I shared these findings with both the manager and the owner during a conference call. Despite the owner's initial reluctance to incur charges for today’s visit, I clarified that the day's work, necessary due to the SCALD test requirements and unrelated to the probe replacement, warranted normal billing.=a4f6bff8-51bd-491d-9180-f0fc07214ee2 Resolution: The owner, although initially resistant, agreed to discuss this matter internally and assured that any payment due would be delivered to our office by next Tuesday.=b6765224-0cf1-4b80-aea2-3f6f1f73520e Additional Notes:=5a9cb07e-4648-4096-975d-77f767f9f92b =fe67ec3c-1ca0-49a8-8219-5bb6c6e87f24 Future Tank Testing: It's important to note that no fuel delivery for Kerosene is scheduled until August due to seasonal demand variations. Consequently, the status of tank testing will remain unchanged until the tank holds a minimum of 200 gallons, necessary for accurate compliance testing.=32a5ff1e-e7ce-4d20-9528-d539bb56b47d Conclusion:=f8348170-5238-4c5e-9e8b-40e0190c93df Today's visit involved critical diagnostic activities and stakeholder discussions to address compliance issues and equipment functionality. While the immediate financial concerns were tentatively resolved, continuous monitoring and follow-up on the tank’s status and inventory levels are recommended to ensure compliance and operational integrity moving forward.=a7e85ff9-15cd-4827-b019-fea021aa2900
