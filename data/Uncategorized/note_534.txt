Investigated issue with FP 17. I was able to get it to a state where I could test cards, I would get chip read error when tetsing EMV debit. I replaced the UX300 and activated it. Still same issue. I purged and reset the controller (Panther) and issue persisted. I updated the OMNIA software to 4.9. I also updated the software on the UPM to match side B (52.11.47) which prompted the secure update again (15 minutes X2) I now was getting "PIN Error r4". I referenced manuals but could not find this particular error code. So I contacted GVR and RKL'd and TLS cert downloaded to the UPM again, still problem persists. I then replaced the UPM, RKL'd, TLS'd, activated and purged the new device, Afterwards I was able to test Debit EMV transaction successfully.=726cbbcb-a790-4958-8eed-2af975e49f63 =fa2a7776-eef1-418e-bff0-a63cf8f3c01f =c4b5682f-9377-4fee-9694-6922480de756 14.75 - 16 RTT Shop (Got parts for tomorrows calls)=b25fbe15-ad79-4f2e-bab8-a0ea5be973dd =0ebfabc2-c0a2-45c3-a5be-372db8585222 16 - 16.5 RTT Drive Home=37394a04-49c2-4206-b9b9-83dda3aab567 =de8ccf1c-4d96-4ff7-86eb-7c4644df29bb =7370baba-3670-4209-8b26-6a78ccaa8f56 =47d93e5a-b357-4a53-b0f0-188b31a43d91
