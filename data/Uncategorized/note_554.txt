FP 3 the CRIND was locked up. After rebooting the dispenser the CRIND started working. We rebooted the Commander aswell just for practice. The register was showing System Not Registered messages. I attempted to register the COmmander, but the site does not have their ASM agreement active at this time so I informed the manager of this.=a1b38a4d-b345-4fe1-b75a-df1d9f226d69 =692359c5-8456-4529-9d60-c6e944798b96 T11.25-12.75 61miles=bb0e1892-a5ac-4026-b57b-d0f1ec26075e 12.75-13.75=8f78b934-03b1-4fbc-8c8e-9f0ab4bd873e 221202-0117=fbf6eb4c-40e4-4db7-9891-579e49234e0b Raymer Oil=53bd04b4-efb9-4cbd-81e8-5394cf79e117 3241 Harmony HWY=df419fdf-4f9f-405d-8380-66d8659d7b24 Harmony=30743d3b-27ac-4a4b-8fc1-7e41f9a7a912 =571c1d11-9902-44b2-9186-716024964451 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I tested a debit transaction which prompted a processing error when PIN entry screen displayed. I checked the configuration on the commander and sent a download to the card reader. I tested again and got a transaction denied error. A customer used FP 1 while I was working at FP 2 and the Applause media started playing on FP2 whilst dispensing was active on FP 1 telling me something was not sequenced correctly. I checked the network configuration of both sides and re-assigned IP to both card readers. I also went into the GSOM configuration on both sides and corrected the Media to point at the right dispensers. Afterwards I was able to test a Debit transaction on FP2 successfully and the media displayed on the correct dispenser. All test ok.=12400f80-a549-46c1-b6b1-16e6ac4f1027 =e37432ad-0619-4cd6-be35-79a39d86da55 FP#2 (EN00209048)=e311d329-9d6b-4496-8eb0-d789116569f5 =1a7c625e-cc17-4e56-8af4-541f2bc5d9ef T13.7514.25 36miles=a040c809-feb9-451a-81e5-4edad22ff38b 14.25-14.75=d8e7b632-b3b8-4f45-9cd4-0cbc791d1b5c T14.75-16.75 115miles=91b8d7bf-e451-4f1c-82da-bf3de359623c Run-In=8c2913b1-5071-47a9-97b1-798c39936a0b Raymer Oil=08406208-d090-4a7a-9989-449f0df8f4ff 702 river st=b9244b87-b93d-402d-b593-bea842264e4a Wilkesboro=4cc2bcc3-191e-47b5-8ed5-61c6fc7746f4 =013fe1df-50db-4c34-b0e7-525806ac13ec Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.
