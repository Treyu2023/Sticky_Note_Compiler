We could not find the password for the Evo and connecting laptop did not help. I contacted FFS tech support and they remoted into my laptop and sent a file we put onto a thumb drive and used to reset the password. the Password has a lot of rules so the simplest password we could use was "Administrator!1"  and this is applied to the user admin. I have written it on their device cover for future needs I also left the thumbdrive in the EVO if plugged in it will reset the password and its specific to this unit.=3620f6c8-90d7-4f00-b09d-6e2bf4dcd009 I looked into the issue with the Off Road Diesel Probe and found that with the probe end disconnected the readings between all 4 of the ries being used for the black connection including the bare shield connection we arent getting stable or in tolerance readings I saw between 5Ω and 19Ω. I gathered pics and measurements for a quote to replace the cable. All work completeat this time.=0fe7b39d-bcfe-46df-b990-2bb9b28c29f5 =30139c90-50df-4ef9-a328-c663efeca252 =71f8da0a-829c-4ef4-9efd-5c1fbe461aa6 =206a1679-9302-47de-814b-9cca1f94e0b2 =2a380844-a237-4654-85b0-a126b6f46503 =516f7628-a9fd-49d9-9000-37ada1688476 Pic and go number 2  =localId_0840ca3226a545cd83233ef6cc98f3c0 =localId_314279c75f3547d187479f6d6e2fab77 =localId_8c5aa96a96fa4c8686848e3d62d83114
