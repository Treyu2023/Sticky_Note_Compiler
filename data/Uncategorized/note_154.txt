I pulled the tank information from the veeder root. I found that the tank is programmed with a 1 point profile, no charts are programmed. This is because 711 uses BIR and DIM modules to collect sales and dispenser data it then uses to map the tank. I was unable to locate the tank charts or manufacturer information from the UST permit. I see where the ticket notes stated someone referenced the tank chart, so I contacted Charlene Whirly with Guardian compliance and got her involved. Together we could not determine who put this call in for service. This is a compliance issue and should be dispatched by 711 Compliance, problem is other than this report from an unknown inspector no other issues are known. Charlene also mentioned that this site is under variance so there is no problem here other than the previouse inspection.

I tested FP 5/6 shear valve, The site is equiped with OPW shear valve I have a replacement part with me, but due to the placement this will need 2 techs. additionally there is water leak in or near the containment sump and the water level is almost to grade. This needs to be pumped out before repairs can be performed to avoid getting water in the diesel piping. see pics. =012fe832-cc69-47f5-8351-1de2a6ab8203 =d411cd3a-1a72-46d7-8c9c-4c7bc3d61bbc 15.5-16 15 miles=dbeaea2f-e717-4e8b-ba02-d985b228c26d 16-16.5=d8fe730c-207c-4db7-8c5c-e859a4729da7 16.5-18.5 120 miles=944eca1a-d331-44a6-9931-eaeb9914b4b9 230215-0114=d3b06cf2-5332-4c80-995b-fd245978af1a PO - FWKD1405317=654a8815-a759-4ed5-a6ee-04d504811e66 CK=f1703d4a-91a5-43a0-832d-6a3c91f037e9 249 Carrowinds BLVD=5d8059a0-d958-4489-af92-53b725895c53 Fort Mill=780c3dee-f227-4f55-be08-3e5f345245fd =0ca456e3-7793-41f6-9717-d147f2f7bb73 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD, but I was unable to check in to CK IVR with error "work order could not be found". The Door node 5 supplies power to the PPU board. I replaced the door node and this corrected the issue.
