After discussing with the manager David it was apparent that the sale on FP2 had cleared. FP 2 and 3 were bagged. FP3 was closed from the register, opening it from the POS corrected this issue.

I explained scope of work to the franchisee. The site chose to perform a shift change before we de-energized the control circuit for the E-stop. This way we don't have reporting issues with the electronic dispenser totals. I replaced the E-stop switch and box plate cover. I re-energized the system. All test ok.=localId_beaee7ac8fbc46f68b0c3bc896911ca0 =localId_dc417c9a7ef9444a8ba60c5705c22e51 =localId_328cee6e1d334c728fca8b07d20f5ff7 14.5-14.75=localId_208555ee119e42fe9cce9ecdfd434376 14.75-16.5=localId_4676927996bb4b7c9fc1e09ec2825579 16.5-18.25 end=localId_df9eee73ac5c46faaa067422f29e7cd3 137998=localId_660df018d792473ead33c6f243960144 FWKD4231666=localId_3d17c960084f4984bea03dce2cfbc944 711=localId_cdc7a2d6ea064a97aca76cacb71ca58e 3602 Lancaster=localId_a5dbf5c4f455436f8b9dee9f0f717ca4 Dallas=localId_9f4fa2ff821f4afca4e4d3a7713e7c9e =localId_fd104be33cba4fc597b7d8d1d516c72a Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. FP 4 was at issue not 3. The Premium pulser on FP 4 had been tampered. I replaced the missing parts and tested. FP1 had a price difference from other dispensers including FP2. I troubleshot and rebooted the Passport and EDH. This corrected the issue.  All test ok. Q1 e0
