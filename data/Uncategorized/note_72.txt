I verified the loyalty was working. I went over all the settings for fuel. I went to 4271 and checked against their settings and found no difference. After some time troubleshooting with tech assistance over the phone for Wayne support. And we eventually unprogrammed the managed modules channel then programmed it back and refreshed config then initialized again and it came up.

I had to contact the HD to figure this out because the ticket has no mention of it. I ran a 10.00$ transaction on the plus testing both grades without issue. I spoke with the manager/owner over the phone and explained that this may be a customer issue. I asked that the issue occurs either twice in a row or three times in a day (with more than one customer) before they bag the dispenser and call it in to avoid erroneous issues, recalls and downtime.

I pulled pump logs from FP 6 to find a fee potential under runs on grade 1 (reg) for side B (6) I also saw a lot of error code 5050's which indicates another product flow detected so I changed both proportional valve for reg and premium. I checked for leaks.

FP2 was stuck on CRIND BIOS. FP 1 & 6 were not prompting for EMV. I purged affected positions and rebooted the DEX. Afterwards all positions came up and were processing EMV normally.
