Together, we made efforts to locate the keys for the security locks on the bottom and top doors. It is our belief that the keys are contained within the lock box situated in the office, as confirmed by the absent manager who is unfortunately unable to attend to this matter presently. Despite our attempts with the available keys, I was unable to successfully unlock the dispensers. Regrettably, it will be necessary to reschedule my visit for a time when the manager is available to assist. In the meantime, I will place this call on hold and update the status accordingly.=ac5996c1-5aa9-4508-adfd-803654116634 =0ab494ac-bfbb-4dcd-be72-4d006141755a =4ff5323a-c14e-4a77-a603-805ed21a6ddd =9d190871-e233-4c3d-a3c5-762a3e004126 13-13.5  30 miles=8d3d085b-6e27-4035-9523-327318959387 13.5-15=ed5a6852-ea97-4b20-9f4e-8abf58b0bb61 15.15.5 20 miles=1301cdc3-a2d5-47b4-a162-9dd57a182041 =061a2568-154a-49a9-9ab7-f8e29d93da46 230331-0111=572e2730-bf5c-4aad-8102-612d0a42a5f3 PO - 001106555767=4e2aa521-b605-424c-ad33-0c0fd0b37e2b Speedway #7942=c7964cfc-bfdf-4990-b342-1aa9981b6944 534 N Fayetteville St=f382729d-ed73-422d-a7c4-c6aac9462738 Asheboro=caed5b20-2dd0-4997-ad6a-da54f44df893 =05f241fa-dcae-492f-8699-aa73bb35ca41 Upon arrival at the site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and proceeded to install the ordered components for Fuel Pump 1/2. Following the successful replacement and reprogramming of the dispenser, I performed a comprehensive recalibration of all product dispensers, ensuring that each was set to zero.=26f1c72c-2ddc-47c6-8235-4c008f37a1da =1f3c04dc-aca0-4878-8a83-be92f95411c0 During the process, I encountered difficulty in operating the locks on the upper doors, which were unusually stiff. Unfortunately, the site's keys were damaged while attempting to secure the doors upon completion of the task. I promptly notified the manager of this incident and advised them to obtain a replacement key.=8ef6c692-b58c-47e2-a1da-0e9ad75e6ad5 =e1873168-a228-4c0c-9ff0-3901fcd34d57 Finally, I conducted an Electronic Merchant Verification (EMV) transaction test at the dispenser, which yielded satisfactory results. All tests were completed successfully, and the dispenser is now fully operational.=f467131f-fe4f-4aef-87e2-1faa6085d52d =59f60aaf-724c-4c37-b6ac-db9fc23a7ebb =c89da3e5-398e-45e6-9da7-d719d3a933f9 =b5b055c2-3c7c-4d7d-9c56-9af6c9f30102 =8e68f38a-3372-4129-99c9-4ebf0fe8791f =f22e4a2a-6350-4783-96a2-7913ca1df2f8 =113f3e92-4cac-4479-b0ba-c4c0e6ebb1ff =3a5eb047-85a2-46a8-bf12-039ce1defba7 =787b4fe9-2b49-4092-a500-7459396c596b =02ab3489-57c0-406b-aa21-1e6dc4c7184d =045ddf4b-4e9c-48e9-bd50-bce3133219e8 =116b6ee3-5644-4f66-9f9a-c56daeab2391 =8825f6e7-22a3-4e5b-8a1f-bf6e82393f26 =d846fb93-bd4b-4060-9fff-010e08202319
