I managed to bring the card reader back to operational status by reassigning its IP. Despite this, EMV chip cards still encountered reading problems. This led me to replace the card reader (UX300). However, even after the replacement and configuration, the issues persisted. To rectify this, I performed a factory reset on the UPM and reprogrammed its settings. I also initialized EMV from the Commander and had to reboot it to restore FP2 after the reset. After these interventions, the EMV Debit transaction testing was successful. Everything now operates as intended.=localId_cf477a1d19264e438f5db0c30ae005a7 =localId_31fd0b6433f24c8e8a4e37213c2fd48d EN000307997=localId_2f95bcd3a69849db90a14c4dec405ff0 IN -   987-421-513=localId_a22d87bad07344079925a802cf314129 OUT - 987-347-273=localId_ce12a6bb41ef471899ed9dd10567436e =localId_f50413dffad24b43a7bc65ce788e73e3 12.5-13.5 25 miles=localId_95c4b7df0fa54f259ea2b0a1bb6a286e 13.5-15.25=e9beec47-1fd8-481e-b295-bf9b48cc468e 15.25-16 30 miles (drive home)=localId_db6e2c6a2944401c98dc291d47dbf78d 230810-0160=localId_c36f484a25d8415da1477949672b7a9c PO - 24488024=localId_f669e3c1a33d4705968d1a07163fcecc HAN-DEE Hugo's # 212=localId_10b0faaa64d04d239861e679d0c17867 2829 Randleman Rd=localId_e1e82157c3c34ce2a4df52f6939d201f Greensboro NC, 27410=localId_eef39d9b095d4c77b98afa9ee1d717cc =06bf91f2-2d5e-404a-98e0-da5743dbe1d5 Upon arrival, I met with the manager, Bree, who highlighted issues with the pin pad freezing during customer interactions. After running diagnostics on the contactless, EMV chip reader, and mag stripe reader, I found the hardware to be in good condition. However, I did notice that their software was outdated. To potentially remedy the described problems, I upgraded their system to the latest Viper pay 4.7.10. Following the upgrade, I tested a debit transaction and also updated the software for register 1, with Bree's approval. Post-upgrades, all systems tested successfully without any issues.=localId_0916fdf6131241488ff0e747ff068974 =localId_a2f0be8a6b604611add27fef15e24441 16-17.5 90 miles=4c4d4dc7-fa9d-4ef3-bbcc-95928f5aa95e 17.5-19.5=f67d8c03-12bf-48ba-9c6f-f6fe407c4099 19.5-21 90 miles=11d4dc6d-88eb-4795-a457-c8b02be6b84e 230810-0066=86428cb0-a3cb-4c87-a3d0-4c91963a1843 PO - 24494839=46eedbf5-3983-4edc-8d76-8a37bae3bb59 B G.s Express=b646bfbc-2993-434a-9520-37fd114519b5 16380 A.

In my investigation into the network and after using the BRCM tool, I identified the problem with the BRCM Homeplug component. Specifically, the ports on its front are unstable, resulting in intermittent connectivity. As a temporary solution, I relocated the card readers to another, seemingly more stable port on the same unit. This restored functionality to the card readers. However, given the observed instability, it's a temporary fix at best, and the unit is likely to fail again. To ensure long-term functionality and avoid further disruptions, I recommend replacing the BRCM Homeplug. I am NOT ordering this component unless hutchens asks us to, I would replace it in house personally, its plug and play.
