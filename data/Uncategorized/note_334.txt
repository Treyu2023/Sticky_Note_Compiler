Arrived on-site, checked in with Thomas Greenwood. He met me at the unmanned site after I called with ETA. I checked the BRCM and swapped the rs-232 cable from the front to the back with the old CRIND Cable. Site is COIP, but they are running both sets of 2W. The Pump wires are landing on the DCM3 and passing through that and the CRIND node before reacing the PCN. It works this way, but I would have taken the pump wires directly to the PCN to eliminate the DCM3 and CRIND node to eliminate those potential failure points. The DCM 3 separates the HIgh speed and pump communications, with this configuration they are already seaparated. Not the issue but noteworthy observation. I got into the Commander and initialized the drivers for the fuel and everything came right up and started working. I explained to Thomas what procedures to follow should any similar issues occur in the future. All test ok.=45128f2a-9448-45a4-80b6-79a2d310e703 =73b7106c-0d1b-4f54-822f-50d34e1241f7 =8b76c913-b6ac-4fe3-9e40-aff68c31f314 =f7394968-b140-4b14-b511-978b7c9d68c1 =a9ecb14a-1457-408b-a5d0-b6e04f00482f =dda49f82-8aa1-4c5b-a48e-c42c295ba739 =f9a553b6-ad71-4bff-ac5c-adf497b1d47c =7cd22859-722a-4443-b393-559877ac8855 =a9df8977-6359-48b0-acb8-be0c41f61062 =9c1a9e42-79dc-4705-a3f1-9224bbf8b7b6 =889fc668-1b19-49a4-b365-e1ce71396ed9 =51d3f9de-573f-4c49-be74-2b49fa028a0c =bf01b494-95d9-48e5-a571-bb6c6a50f03a =0b019fe9-0042-43a4-bda0-623eceb558f6 =7a695d1c-b48c-4ebc-872e-fe9cae138ca4 =cfd88635-f0f2-4322-808d-55c835767159
