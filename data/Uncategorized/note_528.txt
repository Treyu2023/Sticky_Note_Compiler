No configuration instructions provided, I rode to 711 @ 7490 Oakmont BLVD and took pictures of setup. Once configured we could see & sell car washes from the POS, but no code generated. After troubleshooting we tried 7 different Null Modem adapters, but none of them worked. John stated that he was going to try to locate one for this device at the shop and return maybe tomorrow with it. All work complete.
