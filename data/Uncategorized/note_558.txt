FP9 had the Diesel pulser removed. I reinstalled the pulser and reset the DEX to address other issues the site was describing. Because of the tampering on FP 9 I walked the line and opened all dispensers that had their seals broken and made sure to check the Diesel on 1/2. No other tampering was detected.

The site server was plugged into a power strip that had lost power. I restored power and rerouted the power for site server to bypass this power strip and plug into the source. After some time the server offline condition did not clear. Restoring power and connecting a monitor showed the server was operational at the windows log on screen. The associated port on the switch was now green aswell. I was unable to reach systems after 4 times. Closing ticket as complete. All test ok.
