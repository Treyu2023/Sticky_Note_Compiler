I replaced the ECPU, barrier and probe module boards in the ATG. The problem persisted. I brought the probe inside from one of the Regular tanks and hooked it up directly to the probe module by itself disconnecting all the other probes during testing. I rechecked the fuses on the Power supply and checked that all of the groundin is <1 Î© resistance. The input voltage is 124V referenced to the neutral and/or to ground. the Power supply 8VDC test point is reading 6VDC and the 20 VDC test point is reading 19VDC. The probe wires are not twisted or shielded so no noise drain is equipped for interference. The intrisically safe circuits share conduit and J-boxes with high voltage wiring so it is possible that intereference is present. After discussion with Admin team I rode to the shop to get a new probe to test. On returning I hooked the new probe up to the Veeder root and called GVR we cold started and archived the ATG and the problem persisted. I spoke again with the Admin team again and this time we decided to return tomorrow with a new unit to swap parts that we know are good. will return tomorrow
