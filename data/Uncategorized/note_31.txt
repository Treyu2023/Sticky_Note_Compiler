FP#6 was working when I arrived. FP 10 was also working when I tested it. The manager described what sounded like the Card reader was locked up. She also stated that the power went out and when it came back on the Card reader issue on FP 6 cleared up. I went over what procedures I would like them to try if the problem returns. I also explained how to reset the mechanical leak detectors and how/when to reboot the RUBYCI.
