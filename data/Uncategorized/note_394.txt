Unfortunately, I was unable to gain access to the Commander using the provided passwords. Additionally, I do not have a current loop board so I had to goto the shop to get one..=6f8c458f-5fa0-4711-93a8-9d24bb6ee83e =b185dd5e-9cbc-4f21-9775-7894562444b0 I traveled to the workshop to obtain a replacement board and subsequently returned to the site. After installing the new board, I still encountered communication issues. I attempted to access the Commander with passwords provided by the owner via phone, but they were unsuccessful.=040f6a01-a1e1-450a-85ff-472475bebd84 =340f7eb8-6c20-49ec-9c3b-0c0759a97b8e I reached out to Verifone for assistance and discovered that the client does not have an active Annual Service Maintenance (ASM) agreement. Without the correct password or an ASM in place, I am unable to access or work on the Commander for a reset. As a result, I must close this ticket as incomplete, with the issue remaining unresolved.=8e76c033-3db8-4bbf-98d6-4616d733b20c =f8c37649-2350-4df5-af20-a71f597836ce 14.5-15.5 40 miles=4ffffdbd-b76e-4cae-b295-79dc8f122fa8 15.5-15.75=669e39fa-ea55-4373-91bf-15e36f8e8c6e 15.75-17 75 miles=f50c8518-f429-411f-bb4d-fe8a8f0882c9 230408-0034=e2c0df0a-edfe-4a49-a32e-64d0c7d960ce PO - 1-5557719922=6a2eebe0-5288-43f5-ad9e-9ba27d39c5eb 711 # 36064=69679c74-01ce-4e9f-a46e-e03b5dea70ca 713 S Main St=11c4e9f5-9012-4a9b-b1e0-79f0e6d657f9 King=e7ad29b9-5a4b-4f07-8b75-d8f72bfc7963 =8bbde624-07e5-4701-85e2-9f889cfcb51e Upon arrival at the site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and confirmed my presence through the Vixxo app. I proceeded to investigate the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) L:8 fuel alarm, which was related to the Regular Fill.=13a224d2-f7ee-432b-9eb0-bd830fb4cb30 =a17ef70e-07c1-4b2d-9e19-14daeaefb5bf Upon inspection, I discovered that the tank fill was completely filled with water, and it was raining at the time. To resolve this issue, a follow-up visit will be required to remove the Petroleum Contacted Water (PCW) from the tank fill. Given the circumstances, I am de-escalating the priority of this matter from a Priority 1 (P1) status. =66c3e706-c7ce-40a4-87be-ab07bf3a8f18 =7245a480-302b-4333-a0b2-1beda34fb7b3 =35a76d6b-c24a-403e-8fce-3a2f0848d3d5
