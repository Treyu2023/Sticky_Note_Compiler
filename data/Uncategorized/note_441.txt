I found the site was setup with VRSD software download on the POS and the owner was told his software was updated. The PIN Pad was also updated as he stated that it rebooted and then he was presented with the Accept/decline screen you see after a software download. He accepted it, but the Card reader would not communicate or work with the POS software version currently running. I took pictures and pulled a backup before running the auto upgrade procedure on the POS. after this his PIN Pad and POS were working. FP 3/4 had not been working since a lightning storm and was bagged off. I isolated this dispenser and CRIND in the FCI box and this allowed me to get the other card readers up. The Debit feature was only giving Network Reject and declined messaged whenever attempted. I spoke with the owner and we turned off Debit and removed the prompt fom the CRIND screens. After completing paperwork and collecting a check the customer brought to my attention that if a card was swiped it was now asking if this was a "Debit card Yes or No". If yes was selected then it would go straight to Debit unavailable. The owner was concerned that this would interfere with WEX card transactions and decided that he wanted me to change it back. I did so and explained that the issue is something with the network and that he should contact them in the morning. All test ok. =59e18fb7-ef00-4169-b356-e57ddd764696 =5bffd662-1eaa-4358-97d1-65c01a3fbf07 =08d763ba-d1fc-46ea-b905-4c926ed1c540 =38ed155e-27eb-45c8-a7c2-531c6d095c69 =1be877a9-84bf-4de6-b6eb-efeea414bfcd
