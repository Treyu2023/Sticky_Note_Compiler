While the card reader needed replacement due to a gate locking problem, a more urgent concern was FP 13 being offline. After assessing the settings on the SSoM and comparing them with the pump's programming, no discrepancies were found. I then updated the SSoM software to tackle the offline issue, but the problem persisted. After replacing the card reader, which fixed the hardware issues, a software-related issue continued causing transaction delays. Only after factory resetting and reprogramming the CRIND was I able to successfully complete an EMV Debit transaction at the dispenser.=d5c70447-36c9-4f4f-8f8a-5ef47c9d4e4f =6941eb60-b708-497e-a1c1-60f2fc6a54a0 FP 13 (EN00009617)=be3e2b3b-4a70-46bf-861b-4eacb03685b7 CR IN 987-061-987=2ab28d57-25dc-48e2-9b98-525085a57e1a CR OUT - 986-346-914=df8fb892-6883-4377-b41e-5cb9f7ecc81f =b1ab27ae-9f45-4ab7-9440-17590b250f95 13.25-13.5=32ef64f2-5b4e-48fa-9bdd-21e9012a9a48 Same Site=88c8d00c-06d8-495b-9c31-fd52b5104794 230803-0230=1df07bde-1a32-461b-a984-21b1905914ae =ad127e19-0c26-448c-a293-41af810fd779 I communicated with the manager, Laquanda, who informed me that the door on FP 5 was fixed and the hose had been attended to. She requested I inspect it for assurance. While the register issue had resolved itself, I noticed that on FP 5, the door had indeed been mended but the lock wasn't latched. I secured the upper door by latching it. All inspections yielded satisfactory results.=b5a38b34-3c0a-4ee3-8cf3-1ba4954280b8 =20d4f9ed-cc9d-457d-a2d5-ce52654cb2c5 =e43839c2-97ae-41d6-ace9-c4d2841d8a0c 13.5-14 18 miles=3e77413f-98cf-4c6f-894b-b71a7217df4d 14-14.5=786999f6-4b98-4bb0-a8fe-1953713f427c 230814-0217=fcdc96d3-eadd-498a-a673-03dd7e765022 PO - FWKD2171416=75c81f70-d3f5-4780-bc5a-21464f495f12 Circle K 2720355=ceb531ed-26cc-4a9b-9f28-8a9f5ce273dc 429 East Weatherspoon St=6bf98797-c86a-461e-9911-67e571a97a48 Sanford NC, 27330=cbfc745f-b8c5-48be-8b7e-46763767f738 =14327ec3-cc65-4308-a0a6-5d1f56f8d0e7 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.

I advised them on the warning signs to watch out for and recommended reviewing the security footage from the day of the incident. The manager noted that the suspicious sale appeared in the morning, suggesting possible tampering the previous night or early that day. Equipment inspection didn't reveal any payment-related anomalies.

Following discussions with the Manager, it became apparent that the issue is intermittent, likely stemming from a networking problem. Notably, CBE had previously attempted to address this issue on several occasions. While the BRCM tool updated some devices, the sporadic nature of the problem makes it challenging to diagnose accurately. I provided guidance on what indicators to look for and recommended system reboots during the problem episodes. This approach should help in pinpointing the specific network equipment causing disruptions. Current equipment tests yielded satisfactory results.=94c9382d-5175-4b1c-8184-d35f4fd0d656 =ed7fbfea-bb93-4f9a-a6fc-a5e7b33e6ca6 15.75-16=6849beca-dd70-4456-9e1d-1a5a5bb6095b 230809-0015=b7e490dd-7f37-4f9b-82c3-ec52ec621e51 Same Site=804ef4bd-3790-452f-b434-85f77ff79c3d =37bbac78-8324-4f4c-b2e9-b809aa20a262 This ticket is a duplicate issue from the intermittent problem mentioned in ticket 230813-0091. Unfortunately the issue is not present at this time making diagnosing it very dificult. Personally I would look into getting an electrician to make sure all the GAS and POS equipment is on the same phase as this can cause ethernet communication issues and with COIP configurations the Card Readers are all on ethernet communication.

The alarm history suggests that a likely storm or power outage event from two days prior caused system instability. Although many of the alarms had resolved themselves by my arrival, an active printer alarm remained, and Tank 3 wasn't displaying its volume. After power cycling the ATG, all functionalities were restored and every tank displayed accurate readings. All systems are now functioning correctly.=1633a558-1031-4731-9e01-f5316e349174 =dd3209c5-c2ec-46e6-bc96-bb9f06b52b8a =6a104467-4c54-4ae0-ac5e-9e0f8e2add61
