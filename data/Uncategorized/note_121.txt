I troubleshot the Diesel Q:3 Line Equipment fault alarm to bad wiring from the building. When i tied the wires togeter I am getting 14Ω resistance inside. Normal range is <2Ω. The wiring issue once corrected will likely fix the equipment fault alarm. I replaced the float kit on the Premium tank. I looked at FP #3, Mike stated that FP 3 was not working. He also stated that neither side was working before he replaced the filter. The nozzle was bad on FP 3. I replaced and tested operations. All test ok.=6c706a17-6c7d-4f3e-9d37-4a625bc03acf =8732991c-4367-4ed0-be16-b6034252c31e 12.75-14 64miles=f53394cc-ed17-4f6d-bc67-9b0f5c9a93e2 14-17=7ed5baca-1222-408a-ab85-00c5486faa19 17-17.75 50miles=c249c915-2ced-41f2-bfa1-654f6e751938 221226-0156=6b729eea-9566-42ed-9bac-efd827e4ae88 Sheetz #727=bd75059f-3eb2-4a36-852a-847f09bc8261 1701 Greenbourne Dr=f54c7b8e-182d-4cea-8014-2eac438b550c Greensboro=5f2f9c26-ec10-4b93-a3b1-b59ece5bd1ed =ed1460ec-bb3a-409f-88c2-ebb2dbec5772 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I checked each dispenser for tampering, I also checked the blend ratios of each position. No issues were detected. I checked the veeder root for alarms and found a slew of . I would suggest getting the tanks and lines tested. The pulsers could be tampered without evidence of tampering left behind. I pulled pump logs from one dispenser and found there are a whole lot of EC4312 and 4314 error codes pertaining to high product low flow and no flow. in the (E85) blends the high product would be the E-85 which would mean that there was more regular being dispensed which would explain this better. I could not duplicate these conditions while on site. No problems were found. I spoke to Mina the manager for this site over the phone and he explained that the issue with the E-85 has been consistently going out since the stores inception. This sounds an awful lot like the issues that were corrected by the new USM (Universal Sensor Module) hardware changes made to all USM's manufactured after 2021. I spoke in detail with Jordan Walker (Sheetz Regional Maintenance manager) over the phone about this to try and get these issues resolved. I also asked him if he could find out from their third party BIR company if the negative variance is offset by a positive one on another product which could explain this issue further. Just have to wait and see what the cause may be at this time until we have more information. All work complete at this time.=9c15fe80-ea8f-467c-a987-944edb285efe =fa8cfcf9-6103-4ee9-97d5-3cdf88569db3 =350ca3e3-1501-48ae-824a-a56ac79fea41 =b1c36b46-560e-4ec1-ae4c-6e034889d3d5 =fdffcb27-7911-4341-bb83-c80817190953 =5910fd84-28b4-4c01-9efb-020de8b77891 =524cd976-fb25-4194-83ed-3a48c7f02ec8 =09000367-23e0-4aa9-8051-35d9e46db70c =34c5bbfb-c6dd-4a27-96d8-5a0ab9bd8c8c =25e30b63-f12b-42d8-b11d-027f8f090a76 =f78d3709-2ba3-40ff-92e6-5ac5ea1eee29 =47b70c0e-7508-4e1f-bb6c-db0bceb44df8 =2f49a288-db02-4b30-bf5e-e69f3f24f935 =20748c97-ffbb-4954-87c6-9a14703ab1be =312e4c57-8f1e-4fe3-8ed6-8d3c4ad818dc =21c34fc1-27a3-474e-a555-c045fd6e9c7c =ec13b083-4b6d-4041-a786-6573d4ca6089 =1347695d-47a6-4638-ad5b-0a1006ab75e7
