Premium was slow but I noticed reg had 10 micron filters installed also. I replaced all 4 of the filters with 30 micron. Premium was still slow on testing. I replaced the mechanical leak detectors on Premium. Afterwards I tested flow rate and it was no longer slow.=localId_7bdfdcd9ae014aaa9fea214219718114 =localId_0bacbbd33fe0400683f3f7c2395ebd0f =localId_c30b7fd2f5294e438ba8d9218bf0b987 17-18=localId_1b59b6b9346946da9fad6f608a870a35 18- 18.75=localId_59a478d14b5c4a67bd17022e674f84b7 18.75-20 OTTDH=localId_506ea965c6504d449bfb3b2e015b0ecf 192008014=localId_7d024b7999e84965ab8aaecff507c920 RT=localId_8248d57bd06d48c8977ff8cf3807ce16 7001 BOAT CLUB RD=localId_ce5a6734345e49c09d19fb995013497e Ft Worth =localId_c94a7781d6544125830cc5c6c99a27c0 =localId_9ec9140cf5314fa29718fde07a7ff11d Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. Based off what's already been done I focused on the network side of things. We ran the BRCM tool and diagnostics all passed. Tommy contacted RTSS and spoke with Julani who told him to close this ticket as they would create a new one for NCR.  All test ok.=localId_d0c8f1c5e30546fcbd71383bd43e8cb1 =localId_e0f047fc911a40a7aefe9227945938cc =localId_58b610033e574487a6784041d6fc2adf =localId_b6af501e32d6423fb0b4e788a3d20e84 =localId_a161448617004859bf42cac8ed69b6f5
