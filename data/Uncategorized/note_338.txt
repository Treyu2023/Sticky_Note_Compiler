My task for the day was to install parts that had been drop-shipped to the site. These included a DSL Float kit and a 101 probe specifically designed for the Incon TS-1000 tank monitoring system.=45ea0e23-d6f9-4a27-ac3b-5bbe52f875ab =5727f32d-7c57-463a-91da-bc2217563b19 After the installation process, I moved forward to program the gradient and probe type. However, the probe remained offline. To remedy this, I remade the electrical connections and installed the new pigtail, which effectively brought the probe back online.=4b23bc72-fbcf-40c4-830b-144252111bba =1fccc0e1-30af-41e5-8c52-ca2413fd6265 Upon inspection, the ATG indicated that water was still present in Tank 1. I conducted a procedure to pull samples from the tank and reported the findings. At this stage, the site cannot sell diesel fuel. We will follow up with either contaminant removal or a tank tightness test, depending on the requirements.=9ea86cb3-4d19-4a07-a4a8-d3b86ffa266d =bfb4ed8f-c622-439f-92e5-fc39566abd48 All necessary work for this visit is complete.

FP 25 was functioning normally, but FP 26 displayed a "Please Pay Inside" message. Despite power cycling and purging attempts, the issue persisted.=986b123b-2cfc-4b71-ae71-549eff2a8cfa =0fad90ca-a024-460d-afeb-98f8e2510de2 Upon examination, I found that the boards of the dispensers were communicating adequately, as evidenced by the LED lights on the Dispenser Control Module 3 (DCM3), Card Reader in Dispenser (CRIND) node, and Pump Control Node (PCN). The problem, I suspect, lies within the Nexgen component of the system.=fb6f96ed-8c70-44ea-babb-f06a57e4e24c =f1918a94-89fb-4a62-8be0-f56ec9a6781c I attempted to run the Back Room Control Module (BRCM) update tool, only to find that the BRCM was not being used for the diesel dispensers despite their configuration as COIP. Interestingly, they were not detected by the update tool.=d6885c69-da4d-4673-b93b-910e23c9c7db =e1a31aa3-dd9d-473c-89ae-8df682e97447 The Diesel Card Reader in Dispenser (CRIND) seems to pass through the BRCM and come out on a serial channel to the Nexgen, creating a rather complex configuration. I couldn't access them from the home plug with the tool. Despite these complications, I successfully updated all of the gas dispensers. However, when running the diagnostics, it indicated severe communication issues with almost every block being displayed as RED.=394905ea-cb01-4dcc-a1d7-e8dbb32aea1f =c2267381-e09f-4b32-91e5-b7ccdcbdc6d8 Given the ongoing repairs by SPATCO on the diesel lanes in the back, I believe it would be more appropriate to troubleshoot this issue after the other diesel dispensers are back online. I've attached the diagnostic and update screens for reference.=10163637-3b68-41ee-a71f-4a3bee03d665 =300087d7-adf2-4ae2-b52c-19468aeac97d In the meantime, I recommended to Teddy that he should reboot only the Nexgen when the site is less busy to avoid major disruptions.=63e973e3-0591-4d72-973e-a52748e03c0d =94b04600-531e-41a0-8031-07573ecd1f2e 15-17=40ab302e-084f-4eb6-aa5e-228d488fe7ab 230717-0420=54848888-fad4-4586-89c5-9d160d49e811 PO - Get SR=75a1591a-9668-4492-9af7-c968c7c41949 EN=d324b8bc-1fbf-4f79-be69-b907023cbee9 9587 Charleston HWY=ed634bef-53a6-4ebc-b937-51e944da72e8 Saint George SC 29477=6d6c9b9e-ca8c-4e11-848f-775e9c3984d1 =7dfb6b36-0a41-4048-bbbe-fb8c0ed5d273 I was already on-site when the manager described a meter creep issue with Fuel Pump #5. After conducting several tests, I determined that the issue was not meter creep. Instead, the problem was that the Premium Grade selection was not working properly.=b76e6a67-868a-4cda-aec6-d75c0a7c07b8 =ed949c3d-0272-42fe-973a-b85bcf79fed1 To resolve this, I replaced the Price Per Unit (PPU) board for the Premium grade on Fuel Pump #5. Afterward, I reactivated the card reader. All tests were successful following this repair. Everything is now functioning correctly.=fa03a1cb-6fa1-4d4d-8eeb-fa42033d70a6 =a0f4ab6f-131d-4534-95cc-0a393442bea9 230710-0169=6c0e3b10-3edf-4d06-9453-3bfc800baf1e PO - =8d270e94-56c4-422a-ba7b-bea4cfce9de5 9587 Charleston HWY=cd1b8736-c6b5-43bd-8982-cfcf4c3d64de Saint George SC 29477=97e27936-96a8-4ca8-a6c2-07dbcf96385e =c72a4739-3317-4931-8db4-9dd52029526b 230711-0363=ab414cc3-b19d-4c92-a2fe-5a850b6c48f2 =159c9d7a-3699-483d-ae8e-d50dee86f795 PO - 160204035=0475b321-ccd7-484d-a5de-dc299b241b5a 9587 Charleston HWY=1d90fabb-5b57-4105-9afa-c3ba64643b88 Saint George SC 29477=d96545f9-06b7-4185-96c9-97e87b1af8c3 =43326782-6d8b-4e10-a559-9f1838244946 =58bb7a8b-14c2-45c9-9e0c-940e56232b76 =6e294060-ad44-4b6b-9579-0c1edf8d0519 =85710545-a104-4eab-9c8b-244bf28c1f8b =28e6ee0d-1c63-4717-b31d-4cf6041c89e5 =5caf03ff-af96-4583-b415-4c12683fcbc4 =bf59adce-16d1-435f-a605-edf3f24cfc3a =b4544c67-94c5-4940-bba6-dfda7491085a =61bd5ce7-6dbb-4c1c-9ee6-4d5ee4f3f27c =199aa9d8-6d23-4fd4-97c0-dcde4a00cecc =93ab70ba-5467-411e-8683-d1b75fa8313b =b9e41d8b-5d08-493c-b485-4312b80cbe8d =a848659e-500d-4cc2-8f57-cc6582acad65 =f874d987-d3c9-4595-a80d-e390de9223e1 =680a09ea-88fe-464e-b185-5f945a66a96b =f7940d7e-da0d-4958-b920-90fbf270949f =237dc522-d58b-4684-95b2-4e7b036ecc8a =9de7a924-8dbf-496f-b095-a04e97af84db
