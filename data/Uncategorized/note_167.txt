I conducted an assessment of the fueling system and noted that customers were fueling on 3/4 while positions 7 and 8 were only diesel positions dispensing slowly.=5ad35167-3824-469c-9df2-2f2e27c5529c =d03d3744-79eb-452c-99df-7249050ec93b Further examination revealed that the filter installed had a rating of 10 microns. After replacing the filter with a new 30 micron one, I retested the flowrate and observed significant improvement. Additionally, I obtained a backflow sample from the filter, which exhibited the presence of particulate matter but was consistent with expected levels for diesel fuel with a 10 micron filter. No evidence of water contamination was detected in any of the samples taken.=804999dd-2380-46a1-ba71-689dd590cb7d =875ad93a-198c-49b7-aef2-e30dd31c5805 The samples collected from the fuel tank had no indication of contamination, and all tests confirmed that the fueling system was in satisfactory working condition.=4cc7949c-6e13-496f-84bb-4b4b9f44b6a0 =e2cef101-517e-4f39-89b0-42a1aa6e7fc8 =6e0e3c05-732b-46a2-bc46-1389c74f4900 11.5-12 10 miles=c5c2bbf0-b7f7-497b-9ade-24c627ca86c2 12-13.75=ab52cb65-180b-4639-86bc-90317502b66c 230313-0108=326c46a7-ace7-4c03-93eb-9b4d296c8da1 Low Price Mart=bc218da8-040a-4113-b1a4-ce3c3242bc21 627 N Main St=f200af07-9bb6-476f-bf2e-1957c0bed2ec Kernersville=24a3cdbc-11d0-46a6-845f-dd419a59af04 =3c4f222e-e8ff-4ed6-8bec-c25b6ba20020 Upon arriving on-site, I promptly checked in with the Manager and was informed that FP # 1/2 was malfunctioning as a customer attempted to fuel. Upon investigation, I discovered that both the premium and regular shear valves had been tripped. To prevent such occurrences in the future, I corrected the issue and made adjustments to the fusable link arm.=703c823a-db7d-4dc9-b585-fb6bfb0bd283 =565b89ab-13f4-42fa-a607-ae189a205802 Furthermore, the printer on FP 4 had shown low paper, and upon inspection, I found that it was not communicating with the CRIND. I resolved this issue by changing the USB port on the PIP3 and reloading the paper, thus remedying both printer-related issues.=ec94f245-6eb7-4c45-becf-e7e9f7a5fbe1 =9158f631-12e8-40ae-b988-f15019cd2223 I also made changes to the forecourt programming on the passport system to enable the use of debit cards. Although I had tested a card at the dispenser, it could not serve as conclusive evidence since it indicated insufficient funds. Consequently, I had to wait for a customer to fuel using a debit card, and upon successful completion of the transaction, I was able to re-print their receipt from the register, which validated the use of the debit payment method.=500024f5-6952-4835-8878-51f746577c94 =3d531a7d-2f74-4192-903a-72fcff6568ba Overall, all tests were successful, and the issues were resolved satisfactorily.=99db2e18-c34f-4969-9f8e-637f176f64ee =29f64587-c4e8-4fb4-ae31-4bb2c45ccfca 13.75-14.75 50 miles=a3ffbad0-b6db-4c08-9300-1db4fe840f4e 14.75-16=7e6261df-1cb5-4017-aad0-9ca635c52d47 16-116.75 41 miles=25f6634b-7cdd-4b65-8f7b-6fcb9c2cf4e4 230308-0097=074aa926-2a35-464a-bb0f-8e58a503dd8a PO - 0257152=48639f27-fbea-4f2e-ae49-844c98c9d0de Speedway#7379=cb0c1e45-ead4-4d43-a4e8-fadf015c1ee3 5916 W Market St=c25b5b10-fa8d-4e28-a298-8d2266adf248 Greensboro=57d26c82-7531-49b9-8efa-0540faa741d7 =55f3a4fb-48f2-48de-9cd0-808154e82d15 =72012a7a-429d-4efe-80d9-f4769cbb5b23 Upon arrival at the site, I duly checked in with the MOD. Subsequently, I proceeded to install the Power Transformer/Supply that had been previously ordered for dispenser 5/6. However, the dispenser failed to function despite the installation. After a thorough diagnosis, it was determined that the Power Regulator Board in dispenser 5/6 was also faulty. To validate this finding, I removed the board from dispenser 3/4 and temporarily fitted it in 5/6. As a result, the displays appeared normal and functional.=79d4699e-c0b6-4b1a-9c85-22f43daf531e =a49d2e2f-9ee1-4f82-9f14-f0fb4eb42e86 Thereafter, I reinstated the Power Regulator Board in dispenser 3/4 and ordered a replacement due to unavailability of stock in the local vicinity. As per the information received, the replacement part is scheduled to arrive by tomorrow. I plan to return to the site and replace the defective part with the new one.=bf3ca85d-2d0f-44a8-96ff-205cb3c81920
