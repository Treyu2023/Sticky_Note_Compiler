Subsequently, I checked in with the support team via email, providing them with specific site information, which I believed would facilitate the process.=2dbab88a-5099-4d5a-8871-dd18e94f0de5 =865136e8-d83f-436f-a55b-82c606fe7f20 I am pleased to inform you that the playbook has been completed successfully. However, I have encountered a minor setback with outside EMV transactions displaying an "invalid resources" message. To further clarify, I was able to perform credit transactions with EMV outside, suggesting that this is not an EMV issue, but rather a Trendar download issue.=51c0263e-888f-4d35-b7b9-ed32f7238a2a =31c195e8-ed26-4eef-bce3-5b1c8d14b3ca In light of this issue, I have reached out to the project team via email, which is currently the only available means of communication. All test results have been satisfactory, and I will continue to monitor the situation until a resolution has been reached.=8fd5e48d-35cc-4b15-a681-5e96b85fe2c4 =9c2dc906-601e-41d2-acc5-3a045b7feb51 =784909eb-17b9-4790-83b8-bba2c628f0ee =4c4c8037-caa3-47df-9a84-a559eaaa94de Green > Password > Green=cc4f9bc6-c565-4f95-b439-c49e134df023 =23451780-39f8-4c9b-940c-4743ea120cc3 Thumb drive password=9798e9af-f336-4c83-ad57-9a7cb118fbfd 2431373=4dc0751c-a81d-4fb0-977f-4be12cffac24 =57ff02d9-8dfe-4c5a-9b11-aed5b09626e6 =24e73d68-e198-4158-b53d-10787ef34f4d Trend R Alt Windows login=5b88c483-64dd-4360-8417-0f5cd12ab676 Ctrl+Alt+Del=74e063b8-ebac-4ad2-a7ac-3ba7575b7c2c Change user/Logout=264db3c0-1de5-445e-8fff-2d2b2487072b UN : localadmin=4a2668ff-4e13-4b56-ae9f-6ea3a00ca866 PW : comdata1=23425591-174d-4acb-a690-543b1e1a2771 =8dc74d63-83b9-4f1d-9796-5729985e6e4c =9a05bbb4-b4b5-4c0b-a1e0-ea4490ca1496  All-Cashier login to Smartdesq application changed to passcode 9999.=5286be20-82c0-41e8-b5de-5c73b64d7916 =cdf1be6f-11cd-47c0-a849-9d4ba6e52c70  Default Admins passcode changed to 1234. =df704bfa-4ab1-42fe-9c1c-460f99949cf4 =f29b337f-287e-4f7c-a6f4-57f1bbb12a9e NOTE: If the system prompts you to change the password, change the password to 4321.
