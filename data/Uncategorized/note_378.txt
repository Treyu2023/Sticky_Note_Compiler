Please note that this service visit will not be billed due to the oversight made by one of our technicians during a previous service.=fd5cfc0b-f24b-4ec5-9482-d12245849f71 =1dcea1a8-9f22-4e6e-a5cb-60d436447d2e Primary Task & Resolution:=7e64e6cf-1e16-4e24-97ae-422fa0243b02 The primary objective of this visit was to resolve discrepancies and functional issues on the Commander system.=02463bf4-13e8-46bf-83bb-ebd261b9e40a =c1999e30-1646-4e09-a4b7-f9e9bef8f1f8 Register Adjustments: Modified and removed specific buttons on the register to streamline its user interface.=78c681ac-e60e-4f0d-b7a1-cb193530d369 =fc8e0d09-9102-46ea-a3a2-b75bc8399996 Department Correction: During the deletion of duplicate departments, an inadvertent deletion of the wrong 'E CIG' department occurred. To rectify this, we reinstated the pricebook which effectively corrected the issue.=975648a6-6fe3-4412-9af4-46fa59e5867f =773889ca-337f-49b5-8783-88f983f43c54 EBT Mode of Payment (MOP) Modification: The EBT MOP function and its corresponding code were adjusted to restore its original functionality.=2aabf58d-2fa8-4161-95dd-c071f5918747 =7d2ab287-b162-429c-95ed-78a3840ee188 Receipt Changes: Made alterations to the structure and layout of customer copy receipts for clarity.=ce3d1054-91fe-45a4-b2b8-0bd8f63ca797 =5e8db8bf-8238-41e5-b252-9aa8504d0a3e Product Modifications for Reporting: Modified the 4th product entry in the Commander to accurately depict 'Diesel' and subsequently removed the 7th product 'Diesel' entry. This adjustment was crucial for rectifying back office reporting inconsistencies.=0ddb5743-b7a6-49c9-a486-ec6c1bac4d59 =7e7f90dc-b109-4415-a67f-8886c2227a69 Software Installation & Training: Ensured the correct installation of vital software and trained the site personnel on creating backups on their Back Office PC.

This grouping does not appear on the Verifone report. I informed the site that I would need additional details from PDI to facilitate a resolution from their side.=57a386f7-c9dd-4cf6-8436-0bd71fcab6a0 =72208a9f-e33a-425f-8b73-13f956760dae Conclusion:=1523cfab-8f1d-40a3-b204-e238bbe83324 All highlighted issues, with the exception of the PDI report grouping, have been addressed and resolved. Comprehensive tests were conducted post-resolution, and the systems are operating as expected. I will be liaising with PDI to seek a solution for the remaining reporting discrepancy.=4ee9f615-c44d-4f4f-8b0b-43455e1b534f =1a6e6c2b-9652-40d2-a39b-129e7da23bc2 14.75-15=b67d99a8-c314-4034-9a16-90af8259bf7f 15-17.5=1b89f173-1855-42fd-b336-f8f1a8ce7ae7 17.5-18.5 50 miles=7265abdd-6a1b-4ae0-ba3b-a021b38412c8 230901-0149=b444c8b6-3dd6-45ee-99d3-719f8c103ab4 711# 59952=09f83466-f9f8-40ee-adf9-5e56d1f390b4 1709 Cotton Grove Rd=2d12ac52-8682-4ad9-9147-a2e6c3418601 Lexington NC, 27292=8ab57e8f-533f-4715-8c8b-a8f2f3654c03 =32b63bf8-dba4-4f89-8588-3931aeda6148 09/03/23 RK - Field Service Report=b91fef5c-8c80-4c04-b286-478d558a66ed =f42a7b91-57f8-4e62-be43-df6f92aecc43 Subject: On-site Visit and System Diagnostic=762a92de-d917-445d-b7b8-20a4dcd01f8d =50bb2674-cc4b-404b-be8c-6e6a6c697af2 Site Check-In:=fe440122-0663-4c29-aabb-6df648d45aa5 Upon arrival, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD).=79a0b84a-9ae5-44ab-89d4-65a41633403e =c0415163-a34b-4705-86d7-be5f6a48065f Discussion & Primary Diagnosis:=6b4b428d-b9d8-45ca-9a1a-54392fd656c4 The primary concern, as described by the MOD, appeared to be related to software. After understanding the issue's nature, the following actions were undertaken:=0a137c81-f0fa-426b-b97b-4932fd99acbf =774b7712-f637-43cd-b8f2-b49c0c3e60d6 Software Upgrade: The SSoM's software was upgraded to ensure its compatibility and performance.=ebe9947b-d809-4ff7-aa8b-caa060867062 =2748ead6-918b-4fe0-9abf-a9fd1493eae6 System Settings Review: Verified the CRIND settings on the SSoM and checked the settings on the FCB for both its interfaces. The preliminary review did not show any programming anomalies.=8d36696f-00e0-4517-8b91-7f0b8f1cb919 =d361e97f-492b-45de-a1bb-0504a061a24a BRCM Tool Execution: Executed the BRCM tool from the back room, resulting in the successful update of all 5 devices.=1017b553-7c44-4cea-8998-45d0a5d0c8c6 =bd1fd1c9-f710-47b7-a8c4-b2b1ddd0c495 Diagnostics: Ran the diagnostic tests; the reports showed that the field wiring was intact and in good condition.=cdbc6ad8-3625-4199-a2df-5efddc87584e =5c3d660b-dd99-4d44-b762-d896aec002b7 Hardware Changes & System Purge:=04793ffa-7afa-4b5f-8672-9ea56363d3e8 =5ed94051-bf39-4284-a4d8-a044199df241 Replaced the printer on Fuel Pump (FP) 5 as per the manager's request.=4d2880ed-39ee-43bc-92db-7620902a3a1b Purged the CRINDs for pumps 7 and 8 to refresh their systems.=c593ea91-4f58-446a-b142-24765760e6a6 EDH Reboot: Rebooted the EDH which, initially, showed that both pumps 7 and 8 were functional. However, a subsequent check on pump 8 revealed an unexpected reboot. Considering the short duration it had been online, this behavior was not typical of a standard offline-induced reboot.=96f50e7c-5097-4b1e-857c-0b4356da1099 =04385686-792f-46cb-8355-b189cfb18479 Software Staging Issue: On further inspection, it was identified that software had been staged on the FCB for FP8 but was not installed. Such an oversight can result in memory shortages, leading the system into a continuous reboot loop. Using the M5 Advanced tool, the stored software version was activated.=1733c3b9-f914-490f-b4af-c2d137430de7 =720662cd-aeb6-41c7-aaba-2bb52814f25d Conclusion:=4fc845ca-a6df-4a1a-96d7-fb0049ce71d2 After the interventions and adjustments, all systems functioned optimally. Thorough tests were conducted to confirm their seamless operation, and everything is now working as expected. The software staging oversight was a significant discovery that addressed the core issue, emphasizing the importance of complete software installation after staging.
