Will need to return with parts when we can get more. Site has new printer mounting hardware. The manager was unsure how to load the paper into the printers. I showed him how to load the paper in a few of them.=0589b138-133d-4a3b-861c-a34baf20b85a =ed76ab56-fc78-4b0d-84bd-f2cc6280b2cc Ordered 1 M14330A001=494db255-dc33-4469-b351-d9b5ddac5d7c =001fa780-3b86-412d-aeb2-e161079858b5 =0a491836-53c4-4d77-b261-10eed1dd69c511.25 - 11.75 RTT=2673e4e7-fecc-45e3-aaa1-07a03a91aa9c11.75 -  13.75 RTL=ec46c54b-16fe-461a-b428-a6351b1c624b=b14d4dbd-815f-4364-9926-83f258c12f3aVMS - 130269 =6b058aa9-93e1-4645-ba56-da6d547c185dPO - 180365224=6dc3dbd5-5d63-4e67-a8a7-731b8f4b9289 =f6c4dcc5-d10a-467d-9ec7-475d08f0c9fd RT 649=8ae8c102-2e0d-41c3-8d7d-2e1defdb70b3 2224 W Parker =960cff5a-7bfb-4d77-adac-3399b2ed978a Plano=ffc1dac2-d9e5-45da-a956-e3cc898034cc =b78a86f3-9482-4c31-9ba9-39abc0ab51df #4 is dispensing without payment.

The site asked about dispenser 15/16 to which I made a few calls and found out that a board is ordered for (15/16). Dispenser 4 was not allowing me to dispense without authorization fiirst. I asked them to elaborate and another RT employee explained to me that it was allowing people to go over their preset amount and that it would let people dispense just by lifting the handle. I replaced the nozzle for the site which was leaking, this was not the problem =3edba638-b243-4b89-97a7-4bf1267a9126 =b4fad803-0fbe-4e5d-9f4e-1a6427bd89fb =c58ba1ac-1af4-422f-90fc-2045c1ac5c5c =2655f8b9-316b-44b1-8b33-26ed4b16e26913.75 - 14.5 RTT=fe5b9174-5883-4f36-8ab6-9ce3f3f8738c 14.5 - 15.5 RTL=d3cd065f-3130-49b3-bfaf-6e4f59f4a17e15.5 - 16.25 RTL (p2)=e8f0b6f3-454e-4956-8ea9-9cc214e3ca9b16.25 - 17 RTTDH=312819c8-8f59-4d78-ac35-74b54f49228d=e2523900-2479-43ab-b522-48750ae80c31VMS - 130283=b356d846-3aa3-4f41-b0e6-b0b4b6b5ec81PO - 180460652=6f5c955f-4e0a-4635-b6f9-268eedba3ff3 =cd52cdd5-d22e-4db3-a75b-5b34036d35aaRT 73=5ae92aef-01e7-4865-a584-6685636658d41525 N Beltline Rd=9936e8ed-757f-498f-a628-1c70e4e52043Gran Prarie, TX=4c52a089-44aa-436c-9c14-7a0fb2a2ce3a =ee6ac8d0-cf87-4475-9332-3c5717ce41f4 FP # 2 not communicating.=1bf26e55-2d1c-4546-895f-a43fc5087ba6 =5493721d-48bb-4799-b36f-13c102c2351aArrived on site and checked in with Manager, FP 2 was stuck on the white screen during boot up. Initially rebooting just the UPM brought it back up but then I warm started the dispenser and side B was much slower than A to boot and the UX300 (CR) did not have any lights on it. It also failed to boot all the way hanging on the black BIOS screen with no errors. I checked the OMNIA and UPM software. I reassigned the IP to the CR on FP2. I reloaded the UPM software for both 1/2 to force secure device update. This corrected the issues and made the dispenser properly boot. The manager asked that I take a look at dispenser 11/12 while I am here. This dispenser at first glance has no power. =154b7a7b-5be8-4fc6-979e-caf269fa0e84on checking I found that the power had been disconnected in the dispenser and all three of the shear valves are closed as well. The site has had new dispensers less than a week. I suspect this is already being taken care of. I informed the Store Manager Jenny of this. All test ok.=e0803e1c-de92-4c3d-b3e7-25c3244850f2 =9fbe4040-4e02-4d27-8f63-e25b851b479d =cecf282b-3735-4e09-b0c7-38e105bf4537 =da840ab4-4bec-4836-971b-85c1925a18b8 =e5d8a938-dc81-4dbd-961f-63b23d90558a =c01a530c-7718-4082-ac34-6b13ed322ec6 =0a7c210a-1d54-4859-952e-6208929068ab =ab59f2f5-1b35-4404-9f3c-52d9d965c170  =15f9d74d-f956-43bb-99b8-b9c038993760 =a6a7cd85-87cb-45bc-9e96-f46f7758e891 =0a50bfbe-3dd9-4c87-aa81-02f2cdd022db =61aebdb7-de01-4246-b1aa-c97d49918156 =42bd0bd7-450c-479d-af87-288c1a6ad03f =740802f4-f2e7-499b-bb7c-ac41319c64f7 =3119c35b-7208-4745-bd22-c78ac5b56c47
