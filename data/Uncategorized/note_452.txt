The Cashier stated that I needed to contact zeshan, he would not provide me with contact information. I contacted dispatch and waited to hear back from them. After getting ahold of Mr Zeeshan Cattha I was told he would be on-site in 20 minutes. The cashier still would not let me behind the counter so I had to wait for Zeeshan to arrive due to language barrier. Once Zeeshan arrived and explained the isssue to me. The back office PC is connected to the POS and is simultaneously connected to internet through WIFI. The WIFI drops out when running ethernet simultaneously. This was due to some windows settings and the fact that the Ethernet/wifi adapter are the same device. I had Zeeshan get a usb network adapter then I reconfigured some settings on his PC to make both of them work simultaneously. I tested it myself and had Zeeshan get the back office people to test is from their end. all test ok.=208b4833-7fed-41af-ab2c-22feb3492cbb =1930e80c-457d-492c-9ae5-e66b45cd2a71 90/hr=2979545c-259c-4bf0-b2d6-5aaa6f8c096a 0.90/mile=c2bafe98-bcd2-4375-ad0f-8bd2d9908c99 12.50 fuel charge fee=6c8a93c1-c54e-4487-8c7e-fb1909a6ea77 7% tax rate=8259dd58-2c53-408e-a98f-fc0df16ded7b =01a9a9f9-c531-4819-bff6-7b5838d904c9 =7d6a0f23-0b50-4761-b6d0-ca109ef59180 \\10.5.60.1\XMLGATEWAY=40131d87-457a-4fe8-a525-c1e445ed2ec9 =4fe4ae79-8d07-4daf-aa35-30bdb4493a07 bills truckstop 1210 snyder keins rd.=f7c3c69c-4fe2-4964-9b0e-896c9e974fa9 =2102fe35-b506-4dee-9b9d-acfcba24f8ff =e437e6df-f10f-4197-9ad9-212400351c7d T15.5-16.5 30miles=bbfe1b7d-90d4-4447-b33c-9f12f4b1a527 L16.5-17=4f48394c-f386-404c-bc5b-56d07aac7d46 Bills Truck Stop=da398e4c-05dc-425e-9487-934c3bc321ea 1210 Snider Keins Rd=150392de-9f81-4f8e-8fbf-42f44eca1dee Linwood 27299=6d630382-07b9-49d8-883f-f2be51c31b47 221003-0094=e243983f-ca9d-456a-9d1a-77368e546d32 =1d5a7dd0-097a-4df2-b9bb-72c2f3255888 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The Cashier at the truck side POS stated that his POS was running fine now, last night at 9PM he told me both POS were running very slow and denying both Credit and Debit transactions after timing out. The cashier at the C-store POS stated that his has been running fine all day today. The site has satellite internet with 4G backup. I believe they were having internet issues to the EPS during the evening shift yesterday, but both are working fine at this time.
