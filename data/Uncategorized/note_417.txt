I found and corrected Z modem issue on 17 and 18. I also upgraded the software for the omnia. I was still unable to D register the device. I contacted GVR tack and ensured everything was working on their end before contacting knock. Not pointing out there was a blocked Mac address ending in BD07I connected to all fuel and point connections from the VRC M then ran Arp table. None of the Mac addresses matched. I also ran the BRC M tool and check those addresses as well. No other devices were plugged in to the BRC M. And then contacted race track store support they verified all dispenses were online. I also spoke with systems and notified them of this blocked vice. All dispensers are online but none can register or D register. A contact did not again and had the blocked IP approved, but nothing changed the GVR cloud status.=localId_9d455c7454ba40e0b0ae9ec8ff3e45db =localId_68dd1dae69ec4f239e2d09908cc0dd47 =localId_88278ddd7eda4cf1aafe224dbc21435e =localId_2282b23d230f4f97b5e83304d69ec7b4 16.5-17.5=localId_3c7dbc06128a4a27a70b322df3118b98 17.5-18.75=localId_2d186f14c25646c29840360562b1700f 134973=localId_f47fdf186b2a4390883016697b4d3678 197691758=localId_76577ec444e34048989c421b2ce6eb47 RT=localId_a616b7c3858a472a8e2bae5b92d67b67 2834 W University Dr=localId_e1fd389241db4c1c9c45306da495b582 Denton=localId_985772392ee94d9a94b9c32445a7d14b =localId_4973f912a71a430e92b243b24dab5873 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  Iran BRC M tool. All devices were up-to-date. Around the diagnostics and dispensers 1 through 8 showed delayed TX readings. I checked the 2W connections in these 4 dispensers and found a loose wire on the 2W plug for 7 and 8PCN connection. It would definitely cause the issue we are seeing. All tests OK.=localId_8590608a3dba432a9529d3148453aca0 =localId_42da78a3fe394534add2e0fc5dfe5336 =localId_7bd665faba804fc9bdb1d4742da884ba 18.75-20=localId_d99420aa76d542af9ec8df99a1c07d76 20-20.5=localId_49309887614d4271bd93a76e5c8c6472 20.5-21.75=localId_7012a99424854f3aa63dde4f74259dc9 TBD=localId_7e43286d37d4499e9724177c01fdabdb FWKD3642729=localId_f0013d010e8245ba94140340394b2623 711=localId_b1aacc6f6fb24a6b9ab8a48c1b366dfa 3733 W NORTHWEST PKWY=localId_f5499a4b008343a8bf5def2fae8fc381 DALLAS=localId_3dc5c93121cf4209bf010123d187cfbd =localId_3c5368756d7e452e897fb68bb6375241 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. FP2 was showing a refund due. FP3 stopped at 7 cents. I purged the CRIND on FP2. It came back up to CRIND BIOS at which point I rebooted the DEX. All dispensers came back up. All test ok.
