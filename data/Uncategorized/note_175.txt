Tested fine. The Manager could not give any specifics to which cards but stated that in the past she has had issues with some other fleet cards. I contacted RTSS to get me in touch with NCR to inquire about the card tables. The rep I spoke with wasnt sure of the procedure but gave me NCR's number and asked that I call them. After I reached out to them they told me that RT would have to open the ticket with NCR. I contacted RT again and this time the rep stated that I am to close this ticket and the site needs to get more specific card information so that they may check compatability with the site payment systems and open a ticket if necessarry. I explained this to the manager who said she would forward this information to her team.

Spoke with the manager briefly about the scope of work. I went over the CRIND option settings & purged FP20. I was then able to test this position successfully so I repeated this for al 20 FP. I only shut down one dispenaer at a time because the site was very busy. Afterwards I spot checked a few card transactions and reached out to RTSS and we ran one more while I was on the phone before closing the ticket out.
