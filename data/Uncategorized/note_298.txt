I tracked down the breaker to a breaker box on the outside of the building. Inside there were two Square D Double pole snap in 30AMP breakers 30/30. I went across the street to the FIx & Feed and purchased a breaker then returned to replace it. I was unable to power down the BUS Bar so I had to use extreme caution considering the elements and the fact it was outside and live. The main runs for this breaker box are 8AWG  runs that are tapped into the main disconnect box outside and to fully de-energize one would have to shut off power to the store=a6f28268-1c32-41d7-a8d6-62e4540310b1 =57293b74-5b39-489f-a1b7-dbf02c8103d5 =1ccad732-de75-4c21-90f1-d20565cf34243804 Garland Ave RT630=74f36217-ea36-444f-a4be-91315b6780faVMS - 129932=7eaea67a-4282-484e-be7b-4a41db6d8c3cPO - 179121767=4be0377f-cc86-4c56-aede-8d289bbc47c9 =9a510050-4d2f-4608-ac89-ac4990bccb63 Arrived on site and assisted in troubleshooting the MAG VFC at fault for OC errors.

Investigated issue starting at the dispenser and found no issues at the dispenser with communications the other side was working fine aswell resetting the Controller is required to bring the CRIND back online. I updated the software on the UPM's, Door Node's, OMNIA and PCN to the latest production and PCI 3 42.11.47 on the UPM's this performed a security device update on both sides of the dispenser.  I then ran the BRCM tool and saw that all devices were up to date, It did update the filters though. I ran the diagnostics from the BRCM tool and saw two MAC addresses that were showing unusually high TX failure rate of .69-.89% where the rest of them were 0.0%-0.2%. This to me indicates an issue with the TX wire in the OLC COIP field wiring. Maybe bad connection or stretched wire but likely a pre existing condition in  the legacy cable that only became an issue after the COIP changes were made.
