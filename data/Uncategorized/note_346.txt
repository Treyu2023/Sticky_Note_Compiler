Customers were using dispensers and the flow rates looked good. This site has mechanical leak detectors. It looks like the issue is just in the off times and is temperature related (thermal contraction) I verified that STP pre start is turned on and I also bumped up the lamp test time giving the lines more time to build pressure.

I ran several tests from the tank monitor. All of them passed. The site did not bag off all of the diesel dispensers. When a handle signal from a diesel dispenser is detected on the ATG it will abort the test. I showed the manager how to check for this while running tests.

I tested a card and it worked as intended. Not sure what issues it may have had earlier, but it is in fact working at this time period I witness several customers used this car reader as well.
