The CRIND was normal when I arrived. I spoke with the manager and she explained what souned like the CRIND was locked up with the pay inside (possibly other) key(s) not responsive. After the CRIND was rebooted it came up to CRIND BIOS. When the Commander performed its next reboot the CRIND returned to normal. This is because the CRIND communication halts after 30-45 min offline (locked up) status and only restarts communications when Commander performs an inventory of the CRINDs which only happens during boot up cycle. I tried to recreate the locked up state of the CRIND but was unable to. I compared the programming of the CRIND to 5/6. I turned on Contactless on FP 5/6 to match site. I ran the BRCM update tools from the BRCM. Which did update one device. I ran diagnostics which showed the field wiring is decent. I upgraded the software on FP3 and 4 crinds first to 42.11.47 (for secure device update path) then to 42.11.50 which are the latest production versions for non PCI-5 compliant sites running EMV Kernel 3.09. This is all we can do for now as it looks like a software lockup issue. I also advised the site to collect more information such as card types procedural information loyalty etc. This way we can isolate the problem. I set the time and timezone in fp3,4,5 &6 and bumped up the reboot time to 130 am for crinds 3 & 4. Tested a card. All test ok.=cc379810-9859-452e-bc66-5009c2fd8a51 =16d30244-ee4f-4734-af7a-751115c234cb T13.5-15 77 miles=0aae1c60-7f51-4593-a0e6-dd8f85ba9aec 15-16.25=e46f000b-f3e8-4704-87f4-80aaae8efa6116.25-16.75 Unbilled travel home=localId_c4a7c53b016f44ba950e79089f9c01da =724cf101-f7e3-44e8-a9c3-acf0ec41b46d Han Dee Hugos #204=65f2e83a-ac22-4e04-908e-bf13c5fa6fb7 9608 us hwy 220 business=d34c8eab-1841-47f3-8c66-7882d536aadf Randleman=83ba3e57-7f86-4893-b988-5bf865809adc =702aeb44-b565-4a4d-b2e2-d5008a7dc0c8 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I ran diagnostics on the CR and found many bad reads. I reoplaced and tested the HCR2 on FP 5.
