Subsequently, I performed an automatic upgrade to version VAPS 1.12.40. It is worth noting that the upgrade process took longer than usual for this version. After completing the upgrade, I proceeded to pair the POS and downloaded a Trigger pull and EMV table from the network. Furthermore, I re-registered the site before conducting tests on the EMV contactless Debit transaction, which yielded satisfactory results.
