The Admin password "Slurpee1" does work to reprint he Security Manager Report. The procedure itself is failing because the EDH C: drive has 0% free space. I got Gilbarco Rep Mario into the EDH and we found the network log file was 214GB. GVR rep can not remove or compress this file because their Sequal Server tools utilize VRAM which requires free space on the OS-C: (EPS)drive. We are left with our only option is to clean image the EDH, without being able to print the SMR we will also have to obtain and replace the iButton. Awaiting determination.=localId_e61fe99d5dcc4f68b54e4c0674e60036 =localId_46184f2e82a343ffa8281465f27a5078 PS I think what caused this issue was excessive printer ques. They had a new printer installed 3 weeks ago but before that they didn't have a printer for some time. This cause the printer que when I restored power to the printer to send roughly 500 pages. And I think that's just the last three weeks. I have never seen log files take up this much space it's kind of rediculous but I think that this que was the problem everything else is the effect.=localId_3535508951f341f2acbdd59fdef07fff =localId_9d6c12cdd31d4dc1a0aff4aabd8b404a =localId_28a6c6f67c814dceb8b90749ce6fc912 Deleting fuel files=localId_60fc1bebfb014350934cd7472c468cc3 Stop Edh=localId_fb1c38f73257445b9fff97820618764a C:passport/disp : delete all files=localId_9068b9d921ac4594aa86182dbd0da731 C:persistentdatamantest 1 word=localId_275381f529e0427f83763731f6931ea9 Delete store and work=localId_dcf55d37b1114cacb061771b6853255c Then from ICP on EDH rebrand the site=localId_e72be1813867406281aacfde5b0f91c0 =localId_7ce648c8f9ed4a8fa3f39afc42c6f138 =localId_84410416e24a4480a4a13751fa8f323e =localId_52782a84bea64f9c9e008b1a5a60d227 =localId_529da322dc7445c7b9f71e8eb5f3b4e1 SS14.5-15=localId_0f548d9f2daa42c1a0e2a9df7ceb4629 133535=localId_cc94721881f947548ec4e2e00b92babe FWKD3358444=localId_36b6c89a17594380bc9e01fc0eed94ca 711=localId_37acc150e5474bb6b1fbdde2cdb87f18 SS=localId_949ac418955d4b0e802118fc2bd8145e =localId_0659bd7c97754fc5b8daa7f3622701e6 Already on-site, FP#4 required activation of the display.

FP6 the Mid grade PPU was INOP because the ribbon cable was not fully plugged in. After repairs and rebooting the dispenser this issue was resolved. The CRINDs stuck on pump closed. I purged the CRINDs and this brought them back up.
