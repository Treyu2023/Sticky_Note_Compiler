The L:5 (REG STP #2 West sump) alarm was not active when I arrived. On reviewing the history of sensors I found that on 6/2/22 testing was conducted on all sensors. The following day L:5 alarm was triggered but has cleared on its own.i accessed the STP Sump for L:5 and although water is present (less than 1 gallon) it doesn't get close to triggering the float. My conclusion is that the testing and re-placement of the sensor allowed for shifting/settling which may have temporarily triggered the sensor. All test ok. =localId_d372d6b863d144e1b64ccf6ad92814b6 =localId_a391bd2cc75942b191bfa8f47841611c 11.75-12.75=localId_f4b8862869a44aa28ae9bd42a60f861f 12.75-13.5=localId_10512ae192894d2e9364647b0c8922a8 138214=localId_75b6e42d0edb40e2959728c01f1736bc FWKD4268357=localId_813a93295bb740bd845d447cf89460a6 711=localId_8ba190ab7bf04b129db6ee3be2fcd174 1607 Inwood=localId_90e3bf7ea1fa4c02b464785c806bfacf Dallas=localId_285de7110ffe4b6e90effc660688fc89 =localId_9f8770c14dbf480d9010417e64f7572c Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. FP7 was not having any issues when I tested it. FP8 had an internal leak in the nozzle. I replaced the nozzle and swivel and tested for leaks.

The UPM was in bios error state on FP7. I replaced the UPM, but I could not get 711 personality to load on the new UPM. I had to reboot the dex before cards would work. I also unbagged fp 3 after rebooting Dex. Both 7 and 3 are now working.
