I pulled a snapshot backup of the passport server and attempted to clean image. I erred out with exit code 13 windows error. I copied the base image file 9GB to the beautiful drive I am using. I contacted Tech and inquired about the error. The rep stated it could be thumb drive, port or the file itself. So after copy I attempted clean image again this time with different port anthem drive. I got same error and had to restore snapshot again. At this point I cannot perform a clean image. Not sure why it is failing. I think I am going to need a version 12 beautiful thumb drive. S704 - 80034F DFD. To clean image the server, at some point during the snapshot restore the issue with pump 6 reporting grade 8 cells has cleared up. Clean image is no longer necessary.

I witnessed multiple customers on various not mentioned fueling positions and tested 7 22 and 24 myself. All positions were dispensing Diesel at 8-9 GPM. The Manager Chaz is unaware of any issues after the filters were changed yesterday.

The site is out of regular gas. The ATG shows 11 in at the probe. I stuck the fill and showed 9 the STP is on the other end of the Tank which means it would be roughly 13 inches at the motor. The problem is that the ATG is set to shutoff at 800 gallons and the site is at 796. Motor Runs at 40 PSI on test. All test ok.=localId_f98574b6ba4b4346a6ff16b80a26ef80 =localId_29556d8d2da64129982fc4fcb6d989e1 Before leaving the site the delivery driver showed up so I stayed until it was back up and working. After clearing alarms I noticed there was a com alarm on the 350 so I power cycled atg to clear it. All test ok.
