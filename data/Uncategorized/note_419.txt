It was observed that Fuel Pumps (FP) 1 and 3 were displaying "Updating Prices" on the screen, while FP 4 exhibited a CRIND BIOS error. To address this, I performed a thorough purge of all three positions and subsequently rebooted the Data Exchange (DEX) system.=67fa8a8f-db4d-45d9-b09a-58048e127858 =ba8625cd-56ea-42d9-be71-9fa99680fa04 During the reboot process, one of the representatives informed me that FP 5 had also started displaying the "Updating Prices" message. As a result, after the DEX completed the reboot, all positions, except for FP 5, successfully resumed their online status. In order to rectify this, I proceeded to purge FP 5 and rebooted the DEX once again. Consequently, all Fueling positions were restored to online functionality and seamlessly integrated with the Point of Sale (POS) system.=a39c9303-163c-4c69-a61a-4c2d8e227c86 =6ce0be9d-a158-4352-9f02-32a521bd51f7 To ensure the effective management of similar incidents in the future, I diligently briefed Manager Kenzi on the actions undertaken and explained the troubleshooting process. This knowledge transfer will enable her to conduct preliminary troubleshooting measures and minimize potential downtime.=60784774-04ec-4943-a36a-2ea9ba5a9357 =9fafdbf4-6c57-4245-b3c6-fe6c791dbd15 10.5-12.5 100 miles=247710f0-2365-428d-97b4-b4bce66b794b 12.5-17.25=72b43199-b9d8-470e-9695-8a30039108f2 17.25-18 35 miles=ce67d5ef-f4df-4253-baae-3732083618f9 230426-0301=dce1c2be-c231-4e10-ad3d-2d72e4d168d0 711 #42107=c1725bc3-117b-423e-9641-5c63bf99d762 2571 Maple Ave=0cf21636-4e8a-4fe3-8215-c48cafa89183 Burlington NC 27215=5cad9323-218f-4ce9-81fb-6486407ec405 Upon arrival at the location, a collaborative meeting was initiated with the team to conduct an essential purge and calibration procedure on the dispensers. We encountered a complication with the Premium line, which was non-operational, and an OC error was detected on the MAG VFC.=25a7ffc7-3445-4aaf-b29f-5817891199da =f1d315a5-91d0-4e9a-8171-3befd5c8c6de In conjunction with this, there was a noted issue with the dispensers' inability to activate the STP's. A temporary workaround was devised by bypassing the MAG VFC for regular use, thus enabling us to purge the line. However, the time constraints precluded us from performing any calibration activities.=9fe5e01e-85ef-49cb-b4c3-8258a9ae48bb =fbe6eab4-9254-436a-a9b9-a1da58e1f3d8 Subsequently, we obtained a replacement MAG VFC from our inventory and proceeded with the installation on the Premium line. Regrettably, the new MAG VFC failed to resolve the problem. Initial diagnostics suggest a potential motor issue, but the task of isolating the specific malfunction was not achieved due to the limited time.=6ae5c364-9af5-4d1e-bcff-ab3592d21297 =747830c4-3088-44a4-8e45-b070390af1ca A continuation of the troubleshooting process is thus necessitated, underpinned by our commitment to rectifying the current operational difficulties. Further intervention and troubleshooting will be scheduled and performed as promptly as possible.=987e0746-cc2b-4b7d-b35e-107095ea8f2c =d14bd662-57dc-4265-a88c-59db97661f0c =34e85727-86cd-4a99-8525-d44b0f793804 =8277dfc4-13b3-4f9f-9400-f8fbc91a46b1
