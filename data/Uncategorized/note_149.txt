Here's a revised version of the email:=91cbf113-6e04-4687-ab26-876acecb07f4 =5ae3b610-e51b-4531-8c8c-cd6bda2c5e99 Subject: Concerns about Monthly Bonus=44eb4064-9cf3-442e-b323-f586a92c9b79 =0403743d-d37e-40f4-85f9-d75730d18ebf Dear [Payroll/Human Resources],=dc501acc-6323-49be-a5bb-ec881bbd33d0 =28933229-637f-4f80-9dfb-c382c3e96894 I am writing to respectfully express my concerns about the monthly bonus that I have not been receiving. As an employee, I have consistently met my performance targets and have fulfilled my responsibilities as per my job description.=aa73d630-4717-4980-81f2-298365387d69 =980c0f64-3f1a-4309-b7c7-3a91fa7ff1e3 I have briefly discussed this matter with my service manager, but due to time constraints, I cannot continue to speak with each of you individually until this matter is resolved. I am sending this email to everyone to ensure that everyone is aware and involved in the decision-making process. My intention is not to go over anyone, but instead to address this issue as a team.=0ce4194e-c95f-4cc3-9462-56417c9650b5 =c7f6e331-7ebd-4e1a-92f6-46a079cea759 If any of you would like to have a one-on-one discussion with me about this matter, please let me know. However, my preference is to keep the entire discussion in the confines of this email for accountability reasons.=2c25f154-7741-4b8a-ae59-a77b1482eb99 =73f77a5c-12bb-4006-9aa3-190cea9ef860 I have lost potentially $700.00 in the last two months, and I am not receiving metric reports, which I have mentioned multiple times already but not in email. I want to emphasize that this matter is not going to go away, and it can and will be resolved and dealt with in a timely manner. Otherwise, I will be forced to handle this situation myself.=c65fbdde-f354-43e5-aeba-3433d965ae12 =2bdbe828-f1de-4fd5-89e9-cd4187c0e100 Thank you for your attention to this matter.
