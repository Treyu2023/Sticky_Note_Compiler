She explained their issues in more detail. WHat was happening is not over-runs on prepays but in fact issues with how pre-pays were being handled on the register after timing out. I removed dispenser 5 which they dont have and turned off the ability to post pay dispensers as well as removed the general authorization feature to prevent the problem alltogether. Additionally I adjusted the time the Passport will start warning the cashier to close the day Per the owners instructions from 9PM to 10PM (I did not change the time it will automatically end the day if they forget, this was and is set to 12AM). All test ok.=f7b6f934-4904-4294-a65b-c8a41ff5217f =c7252af5-4b21-4a85-acda-65a58b75a6d0 13-13.5 Shop 48 miles=d522356b-2481-4a7e-89a5-72ef19cd3b93 13.5-14.5 16 miles=6c8693e6-42f9-4fdb-ac6e-b22bfd8529e1 14.5-16.25=5152af3e-e89c-4577-9d41-50caa62d70c6 16.25-17 36 miles=6de3cdb5-bcaa-44f7-aa63-2540f9bb4e06 PO - 1167- mcCray=11db05f6-58fb-4290-91ff-569fdf084b6c 230306-0380=8f9b316f-718a-4826-95f4-46229ce5f3f1 Refuel=9d9dc943-9d79-4533-8a8a-c0056c0b90f6 1411 W Gate City BLVD=0f88a928-83db-48be-8d42-b23b805d2f1e Greensboro=18dd31be-d826-4c29-97c8-ea255abac7bc =99ea4303-56b2-4b32-8674-c418dae7cf14 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. The issue is that the ATG is showing "No CSLD Idle time" for T:1 Regular. This is a unique case due to the fact that the PLLD is not showing the handle or the motor on for the associated line yet the tank is showing an active state. The Active state will not clear until 30 minutes after the last time it was active, also under these circumstances it could be a bad probe or electrical noise and/or bad wiring to the probe. Normally the preffered troubleshooting step would be to swap the probe with another and see if the problem moves or not. Unfortunately this site has 4 tanks the regular tank is 120" in diameter and the remaining 3 are 92" diamete. This prevents us from using this method to determine the issue. I inspected the probe and connection at the tank. The form number is 846390-109. I rmade the connection at the probe( i did not seal with epoxy pack as this is temporary to see if it helps the issue. I am ordering a probe to swap with the one in the regular tank for now. We should check with the site before returning with the probe to see if the issue has resolved before installing a replacement probe.
