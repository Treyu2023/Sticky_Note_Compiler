I investigated issue to find that the ZModem cable was unplugged on both dispensers. I reconnected cable and power cycled dispensers. I checked it from my end with laptop through OMNIA before contacting RTSS for confirmation it was the issue and is now working.

FP7 was on activation screen. I accessed the secure menu and found only the CR (HCR) sensors were triggered. Site informed me that this is not the first time this position has had this issue. I powered down the dispenser and dismounted the HCR CR and inspected the track for issues. I didn't find any signs of defect or tampering so I reinstalled it and flipped the gasket around. I tightened the mounting screws a little extra and reactivated the CR before testing a debit transaction at the dispenser.

The copper rubbing compression fitting was damaged I replaced the but, insert and compression sleeve. This corrected the issue, but I was unable to verify siphoning operability at this time because the rubbing was equipped with a ball valve that maintained the siphon before I arrived I can only guess (I heard the hissing when I loosened the ball valve which was the siphon dropping) during my time here not enough product was dispensed to both pull the air out and offset the product enough to engage siphoning. I explained this to the manager and asked that he check the levels later this evening to ensure the siphon is working. All test ok.
