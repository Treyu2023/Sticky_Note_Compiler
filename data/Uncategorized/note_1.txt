FP#4 was errored out on the BIOS screen displaying "system halted : KO" I rebooted and it did not change where it stops, also red error led flashing on this UPM. I had to run to the shop to get a UPM and returned to site to install it (the new printer housing makes installation harder to remove the gasket and glue from the door with very limited space) then updated the software and activated TLS and Debit Keys. Afterwards I purged both 3/4 CRINDs. checked settings from side to side and rebooted a couple of times before I still wound up having to contact RTSS and have them reset the Fuel Controller to bring the CRINDs online. When I reached out to RTSS they were about to go into a meeting and because of the time of day, site preference and only one dispenser being affected we collectively decided to schedule for the site to reboot the site controller later this evening.

I investigated the issues to find that FP3/5 both have bad driver boards in them. FP#4 the breakaway was not re-connected al the way and would not dispense. I reconnected the breakaway and put 3/5 in standalone . I set volume allocation to simulate pre pays. Premium on FP3 and regular on FP 5 both would not go into slow flow at all and ran past the pre set amount by roughly .05 gallons every time in troubleshooting I replaced the proportional valve and swapped the coils and then swapped the door nodes before figuring out the valve was at fault. The same symptoms were displayed by dispenser 5 I am ordering a valve driver board. I installed one in FP 3 and will replace 5 when I return.
