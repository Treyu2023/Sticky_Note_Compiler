I purged the crind on FP8. The valve driver board was beeping so I power cycled the dispenser as well. Afterwards it was still offline. I reset the crind on the passport. I then tested cards at the dispenser.

Number 1,2,9 and 10 diesel have been compromised. They have been tempered to steal diesel. The same rubber hose device we had been finding at other locations is present here. FP #5 I think the drive shaft to the premium pulser had become misaligned. I could not verify this because of the shroud covering the linkage, I am basing this on the fact that the lift sensor was not sitting flat until i dropped the meter. I inspected components and reassembled them . Afterwards the premium was working. I will need to order combined pulser sets for both diesel positions.
