I quickly discovered the EDH had no power. The plug was loosened on the PSU. After restoring power I repositioned the EDH and cleaned dust from the ventilation ports. Once the EDH was fully up fuel functions were restored to the site. All test ok.=localId_6098deb5b8054445b46d155ba597bd81 =localId_feb4b069f29f4fc6ad29a07b5ee75a67 10.75-11.5=localId_024d6578404a4756936fdd1b867775c3 11.5-16.25=localId_c27a124f60db44ec807aedd352a011d8 Beltline Irving discovered piping issue on fp22 and mag vfc jumpers on fp 23=localId_04328b95cb344dc3896f38f84c561e6a =localId_57b110f1e7024385b70ca88acc5026af 16.25-16.5=localId_eb8790db3d4f4ef382b3ad17ab22739a 16.5-17.5=localId_6805b0ee04384aacaf62c5a2683857c6 17.5-19 Rttdh=localId_4e2cabb580d24c9081ea9953ac67c477 135813=localId_2537938867784b608a68d12bf6a8ff10 200669460=localId_3923b3bf646e47ebb6d74baea53fcd5d RT=localId_5c4c93f7d4f24c22b39dd8756da2d44c 3510 Carbon Rd=localId_c39ec20e9383465f80020128b2cd31d6 Irving=localId_4b9e482b94eb4f35a78efceba1adba7e =localId_5908c13d55ba498aade9c7befde10fe6 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. I explained the situation procedures & we ran a mock transaction from the register. Paying from inside forces truck diesel in the transaction. This means hose 1 (Diesel) has to register a minimum of 1 cent and the nozzle has to be hung up before hose 2(DEF) will be active. These procedural issues can only be corrected by POS/Network changes. ALL test ok.
