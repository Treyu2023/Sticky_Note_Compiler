However, challenges surfaced when attempting to refuel equipment at an elevation of 7 feet; the fuel would immediately cease to flow.=d88d011e-aee8-4b30-8f95-649826c65d6b =d5a2740e-a832-4f91-add3-a2fe5f49b838 Nozzle Leakages: Notably, there were evident leakages from the nozzle valves, causing drainage in the above-ground tank product lines. The site had adopted a temporary measure of shutting off an intermediary ball valve between fueling sessions to mitigate this issue.=5df14ff6-9416-4dad-baba-6142a911c54e =f3560a69-7d7f-4fef-ba3c-65ba4eaaff7a Site Configuration Insight: The facility is equipped with a Fill Rite in-line register, which operates in tandem with a fuelmaster pedestal.=e2dc5707-bf93-46af-9b91-720738c57d25 =43cbaec4-800e-4924-a687-7a0b43db89bb Frequency of Replacements: It is important to note, as informed by the site personnel, that this was the third nozzle replacement within a month.=a29ad0c6-2be6-4444-b3ef-bbaba955ba4d =a9e7b199-0ee0-4f5f-9f73-f688de18f0cf Immediate Corrective Actions:=1a0de76c-573a-4248-90ff-3b527e0c36a3 =87952361-c7eb-4329-abc7-28f7ba3ceeba Nozzle Replacement: Diagnostics pinpointed the nozzle as the primary malfunctioning component. I proceeded to replace the compromised nozzle with a standard Husky variant, post which fueling operations reverted to their typical functionality.=28ccd17c-0928-47d1-8ec4-67698d4374fe =efc1a14f-9ba2-40bc-a31c-544c6fb80915 Product Return Measures: Some of the tests conducted led to excess product which had to be channeled back into the above-ground tank. This process necessitated the use of a harness and the removal and reinstallation of the vent cap to ensure product redirection.=4ef4f993-ca02-4dcf-89d7-861eb23c516d =a0b36116-3747-411b-8507-bad726569f53 Analysis & Recommendations:=85e1ec55-c032-43b3-8ca1-8800bb04822b =1e392977-335c-4a17-a4b8-69a63cdc05f2 Equipment Configuration: The site's current configuration, notably the 13-foot 1" black hose exposed to direct sunlight without any shade or covering, might be the root cause of the reported issues. Continuous exposure can cause the fuel to heat up and expand. Such thermal fluctuations can potentially compromise the valves in both the nozzle and register, leading to unintended product flows.=5f238b03-405f-4e14-922c-ec490b886243 =8feb99dd-3078-460d-a2ab-67b3141c46f3 Proposed Solutions: To mitigate such risks in the future and enhance equipment longevity, I strongly recommend the implementation of a hose reel or a dedicated storage box. This will significantly reduce the hose's direct exposure to the sun, preventing potential thermal damages.=5f1da2ff-bfbc-4416-991a-b38f05b2ba1b =d6778c2a-e41b-445a-81ae-62c4dd713202 Conclusion:=cd91a060-1228-4ef8-a557-e71470fa4a8f The immediate concerns at the fueling facility have been addressed. Given the recurrent nature of nozzle replacements, it's paramount to reassess the equipment configuration and adopt the suggested measures. With these recommendations in place, the facility can ensure optimal operations and reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future. Regular monitoring and timely equipment upgrades will further enhance operational efficiency and safety.=ea8cb6b8-2287-491e-8f5d-9708bcd4e43c =9e752862-c71a-47ce-8936-d1e04aa23bc2 =a54c45ac-e6ac-4e1f-a28e-3d5e37aab7e5 =ca81a427-449c-4200-bcdf-6be02b4447fc 12-13.5 50 miles=2a8d2ea2-ec6b-42aa-a154-42b2a4985236 13.5-18=d33b2986-e8a9-4d5d-b176-93ab3a75b3ac 18-18.5 40 miles=e2c7a30c-7faf-4eb0-823f-f6a208022962 =05cbcb64-b662-4968-9d92-9f6cdea7709d 230926-0293=1f5dee3e-20ee-4b98-bb26-ee6315e4b865 Sky Mart=73853122-7fd3-4288-9f32-6e2c867a33dc 1545 NC 24=4469d4e6-c707-41f1-9d27-5a1b6f000d6a Cameron NC, 28326=43bb8c78-c873-4028-a1bb-9b30fd6406b3 =67ef2616-c8cc-4f80-af76-75203c74c71f 10/10/23 RK - Field Service Report=cf58c6c7-2481-42d8-ab81-c5259b0528f9 =3122d3fc-bc0e-483f-871a-57ad1103f183 Subject: Comprehensive Site Inspection and Immediate Remediation Efforts=343dd55d-47cd-41f9-b62b-f3023560a900 =5e6f8e70-8b6a-4039-8e40-1bbd648f5d18 Initial Check-In:=87e83cfc-b0b7-418c-9bf5-64cab7c5a6a7 Upon my arrival, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) to commence the site inspection and address reported concerns.=6d1ca41f-c4a8-4b07-be16-73dc9477380f =423384f5-06f3-403a-aaef-068d12d90b1d POS System Adjustments:=58a5210a-5b3b-4552-89f1-11e57c9c4763 =f67596b0-2d3a-48ff-a943-f1fca5b26d07 Additional Buttons: For the convenience of the staff and enhancement of their operations, I integrated buttons on their screen dedicated to lottery payouts, as well as lottery and instant lottery departments.=1745fb18-17d8-46ab-a024-59a2c9255cd4 PLU Entry: Per the manager's request, I added a specific PLU for scratch-off tickets into their system.=b3bddae0-f390-470a-8875-8ded1d7c6afb Loyalty System Configuration: An initial assessment suggested the site's loyalty system was aptly set up. However, upon referencing the system's manual and contacting Shell for possible oversight, I discovered an important note. The manual indicated potential issues with loyalty or network-based discounts if product codes aren't correctly assigned. This led to the realization that the site's product codes, primarily set to 400 for general merchandise, might be the root cause of the loyalty system anomalies. I confirmed the network's functionality by successfully using my FRN account within their system, narrowing the problem down to incorrect product codes.=fea7fc04-4f97-4ade-8078-5d0765075cea Fuel Pump (FP) Rectifications:=dee53b1c-04b9-4951-b396-df54812ff546 =2cac1b4d-1f88-4e0f-ae71-bd1a6d8aaece FP 4: This pump displayed a CR02 error.

It's essential to note that the door hinge for this position is compromised and requires attention.=165fccae-847c-4154-b756-dceb4e70713e FP 3: The ADA keypad on this pump was causing constant beeping, disrupting operations. As a temporary fix, I disabled this keypad.=1e54371b-bce5-41c2-a790-ce93e4a20369 FP 2: This pump showcased a persistent "Starting Please Wait" message on the BIOS screen. A reboot of the UPM successfully rectified the issue.=1463afa0-1c28-453e-8421-5a16e015716b Multiple Pumps: FP 9, 3, 4, and 7 reported printer malfunctions. FP 15/16 exhibited leakage in the hanging hardware for Diesel products. FP 2 was not synchronizing with the POS, and FP 4 had a malfunctioning card reader.=c9c1f0e2-837b-4bce-a65d-53ad07e6a446 Preliminary Parts Replacement & Recommendations:=98a73d34-b50e-4d5a-baba-3400eef8f400 =8761c47d-161b-4308-9f3d-28c4a4addd5a Immediate Replacements: I addressed the immediate, feasible concerns by replacing some faulty parts.=eaba8c5c-4870-4dd0-8a84-831fb29759f5 Pending Replacements: There's a need to revisit the site equipped with specific parts: Green leaded nozzles, reconnectable breakaways, 9' black hoses, 2 black whip hoses (all 3/4" dimension) for FP 16 and 15. Additionally, FP 9 requires a Hengstler printer, and a UX300 card reader is necessary for another pump.=5d56fad7-c223-4feb-b826-1c539956813a Conclusion:=a3633fe1-3a33-4c18-9866-e858784dfc5e The site visit revealed several areas requiring attention. While some immediate remedies were applied, there's a need for a subsequent visit to ensure complete rectification of all issues. The site's POS loyalty system's challenges primarily revolve around product code misconfigurations, warranting a comprehensive review and potential reconfiguration. The various hardware malfunctions on multiple fuel pumps necessitate dedicated repair and replacement sessions. Proper documentation and timely follow-up will ensure seamless operations in the future.=e7664daa-e0f9-403f-844d-66d3e164739c =3fcdbe46-361a-4dc9-84a0-5ecfc8166973 =d5cfc1ba-f4f8-427f-a9c6-03897ac36aa8
