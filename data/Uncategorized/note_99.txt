After establishing a connection, I successfully verified connectivity by pinging the appropriate IP address while connected to the Mini Server. Additionally, I performed a comprehensive reboot of all network equipment, dispensers and commander, following which the add media content resumed playing as expected. Subsequently, all tests conducted returned satisfactory results, indicating successful resolution of the issue at hand.=9defcc97-0bc7-4ad9-a65d-dd90308b5120 =fe1559f2-64ef-42f9-ade5-0a566ead3654 11.5-12.5 45 miles=f8e3817f-667e-4369-a7dd-5cba1bb36fa3 12.5-13.75=4ebd3a88-a718-4dc7-9767-a6a110175c0b 230406-0117=68570ca2-be98-4555-b239-d526554276d1 PO - DANNY=a05e3e1c-49dd-4e72-bdc3-31ccaa269123 1001 E Main St=68d0babd-e312-455b-b352-9fa3d4bc4bde Haw River=f2988fab-c66b-4d42-8a5a-864a4309cef3 =3a63307b-f544-4d49-bed7-d29ffc486b4d Upon arriving on-site, I promptly reported to the MOD and was informed of an issue with the SMR (Security Manager Report), which was deemed unsatisfactory. However, I was able to utilize the report to gain access to the EDH, although I encountered an obstacle in the form of an altered Admin password that deviated from the password provided in the report. Subsequently, I contacted TAC and in collaboration, we assessed the hard drive configuration and the backup log file sizes. Despite our collective efforts, TAC was unable to establish a connection with the site. We attempted to resolve the issue by clearing the backup mismatch; however, due to TAC's inability to connect, further troubleshooting or password reset could not be conducted. Nonetheless, all tests conducted at the site returned satisfactory results=ed9a49c6-b515-4f94-99c6-7504db62a852 =7a14d000-e282-4de0-9623-66262dfe8efa 13.75-14 15 miles=f5390b9b-595c-4e41-a2a6-85050832c6b8 14-=c22ad1a9-24af-48d3-8595-d42b2c2163c7 230403-0165=482c0ca5-fde3-4cb3-891c-4b8f59e70ba1 711# 42051=1b2b3fbb-f512-4a0c-bc71-758ddcb19cc3 2127 Chapel Hill Rd=63e1a5ea-8bb0-4e12-a561-820f2838534b Burlington=5f6fc32a-d92b-45a1-b65c-c5a301cdf86e =aa6db674-31f6-4f76-a881-512816cb0693 Arrived on-site (under construction) I checked the status of the dispensers to find that they=af92a6f0-5276-41b9-a42a-8a135fd0f080 =b31af1de-233f-49b8-9339-c27d5b8c6e12 =f7869980-b078-4b2a-b6d8-e3a2029b9cc6 =9e80468f-be24-4ddb-81ad-be90fdc2ed2f =302fef86-8a2f-474b-b330-a205d367b85b =f3e1616e-947f-40de-bbae-5663692dd10c
