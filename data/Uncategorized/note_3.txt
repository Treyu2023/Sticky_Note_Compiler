After comple0-tion of work FP 1/2 and 9/10 were offline. 1/2 reloaded software, re-registered the device before contacting TAC. I then reset the network configuration from the buttons on the board the device with the OMNIA board. I reconfigured the device using the Wizard and it came online. FP 9/10 did not have Zmodem plugged up. I rebooted after plugging in cable and still did not work. I found that I could not access the Insite configuration on the OMNIA board. I reset via button and configured via wizard but this still did not work for this position. I then reloaded the software and this corrected the issue on out end=93a4767c-ffe6-4014-a393-666d6f1032cc =af4b2229-b11d-457b-8c51-25c2480b3ca3 =755b4174-6988-4943-9d76-4017a634584d =84758fe5-c4f0-4e5b-84ae-8f2022d58b92 m14004A003 (off screen)=2825bd30-f9f1-4886-92b7-9dc9c3bfe096 =d1827dd4-25df-4113-a7f6-6c775e7b5bdaEN0106251= FP 7 Serial=0332b1e1-bafc-473c-94af-27a25a0ebfe6 =c36825a9-e749-4309-9507-bb77d751206aVMS - 129709=a5a2afbc-4605-4f11-90dd-fadaa282bd8cPO - 178271287=422ac3df-c51c-47ef-9d98-d353f479c08c =f0ed2d84-c79c-4f15-a5c6-a5ec722b2147  Second ticket for this site was to repair the screen on FP 7. We noticed during the upgrade that it looked damaged because of coloration and artifacting on the screen consistent with a cracekd screen. But after upgrading when we went to look a tthe screen everything was normal. No physical damage and the coloration can be caused by video cable and/or software. The issue was corrected with the upgrade inadvertently. All test ok.=fb124370-bb2b-4f85-affc-b3ea99367659 =5eed5b8e-217a-4bdb-bfd6-429cc865e63c 430-530=a6d5f3a8-9762-4540-af94-178c7ed67481 =45e03f3e-3464-41c1-8c0b-4d1590508e24 530-6 RTT DH
