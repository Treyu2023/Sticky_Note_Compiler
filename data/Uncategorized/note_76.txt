I wound up using the stores Wifi after speaking with tthe manager. I investigated the issues with 18 and found that the Primary line coming into FP 18 was missing a bolt on the Cross bar support, this in turn had put the Piping and shear valve in a bind. One of the three stainless steel Allen head bolts has been sheerd off. I informed the manager that we would have to shutdown the Diesel Line to make repairs. After I had begun repairs and had the line in a volnurable state the attendants at the fuel counter brought to my attention that the Gas was not working aswell. I had only shutoff the breakers labeled Diesel and tested only Diesel. I could not at this time try to figure out the wiring/breaker issue because I could potentially have a much bigger problem with the Diesel line being open. So instead I shutdown the fuel entirely and hastily completed the repairs to FP 18. I tested and reopened the store and monitored 18 for leaks while customers fueled for a short time. I then moved on to the other issue at the site with the Diesel T2 Interstitial sensor. The sensor is probably not on bottom of tank, someoen  has broken one end of the pull trace wire. the end thats left in the riser is going in the same direction as the Sensor cable so pulling on either of these more  than likely will cause a tangled broken jam. I spoke with dispatcher and we are going to have to schedule for 2 men a fish tape a sensor and a replacement Chase/trace wire. I informed the site manager. All test ok.=fd93cc0b-c04a-410f-8e8d-68609b254bb8 =b56f4f02-da61-4668-b476-01a184e1ab14 =0b96c105-3b63-497e-a720-76c67a50f681 =f41bf0dc-5f19-476c-a9cd-b773dafdad8a =3c1ec27b-4ccb-45b3-a19c-af72ff5ecd49 =2d05ab42-7749-45c3-847f-437249e315c5
