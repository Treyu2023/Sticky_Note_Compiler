FP1 and 2 had been tampered with to steal diesel. The site has shut off power to the dispenser due to theft. I repaired the diesel pulser after Locating all the parts.

The breaker was off for the diesel magnfc. I checked under the dispensers for the experience I restored power and tested the diesel. No positions dispensed. I checked the Vita route and found they ran out of product on the 6th period at this point I called in and requested a second man for confined space entry. Once TB arrived we were  Able to access confined space and found the test port needed adjusting. Afterwards we were able to dispense diesel without issue.
