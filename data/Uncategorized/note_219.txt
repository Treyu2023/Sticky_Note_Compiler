I promptly made contact with the Manager on Duty (MOD) to confirm my onsite presence.=556f4d9a-693f-4fde-b59d-2f85aea0c87b =0f24cbd8-7ea6-4d31-a7bb-ca3c93442918 Ticket Review and Preliminary Diagnostics:=d3c93a58-6823-4e21-938e-94242ce0ac4a I initiated a call to our Tier 1 Help Desk (CK HD T1) and was transferred to Mac at Tier 2. I reviewed the ticket, which had originated from Tier 3 and was flagged as resolved. The client confirmed that the dispenser had been briefly operational earlier in the day but faltered after a Wex card update, due to a non-standard configuration at the site.=d04cb31d-d0fb-4744-a8a0-09611e6843f6 =14b293b4-15ee-4f4f-96f9-2e2fe7b137e3 Troubleshooting Steps:=72c18b4e-30ff-46b6-918b-6d1a2a27e1a4 =3cb60d5b-290d-4f63-810f-d081ade5340a NexGen Prime Configuration: Prior to involving Tier 3 support, I configured the NexGen Prime unit to properly communicate with the client's network.=2f41010f-50a2-4a05-82a2-17ae0bc7880d =c5a32890-19aa-4f9d-bbd6-48f4f8607377 Port & Loop Error Identification: While on the call with Tier 3, we swapped the NEXGEN box and observed a pump loop error on port 6. An unauthorized cable was discovered in port 5; this was promptly removed.=ca8a5868-a804-4590-821a-42c4d9bb5536 =eb43e1e1-bd6d-4573-adf0-1d2619fbe3af Cable Tracing & Rectification: Upon tracing the cable from port 6 on the NexGen to the floor-based BRCM, it was determined that the cable was not connected to the serial gender mender. The absence of documentation or witness accounts led us to conclude that the disconnect was accidental, likely caused by ongoing remodeling work in the vicinity. I took corrective measures by re-routing the cable and securing it with additional fastenings to prevent future incidents.=57d9acdc-8153-443c-a4d5-44621e2809df =617bc013-a299-4f1a-8113-e8149bb59098 Final Configuration & Testing: Post-cable rectification, the Tier 3 team proceeded to configure the SmartDESQ and dispatched the files to the CRINDs. This action restored the dispensers to full operational status, and they successfully processed EMV transactions.=36890f90-b989-47a4-9902-f04fd4c73161 =5b04749b-cc3d-40ed-bb5f-34fe18205b70 Conclusion:=a4abec4c-d19c-4737-afd4-5630ec29f601 The issue appears to have stemmed from an accidental disconnection, potentially exacerbated by the site's non-standard configuration and recent remodeling activities. All systems are now operational and pass rigorous testing. Given the nuances involved in this specific case, I would recommend a review of on-site cable management practices, particularly during any future remodeling or reconfiguration efforts.=09c3d4ae-6b72-4e0f-b02e-3e2bc3e6f3a4 =e2a53c38-bd9f-4ca0-9acb-96da7677897e =f2f9b5a7-0cb5-463b-8b78-08be743c324e 18.25-18.75 10 miles=509b890b-0f81-42d8-b48b-0093ec4f688e 18.75-19.25=a73da1bc-bfef-4556-b77f-4695d8d216a4 19.25-20.25 45 miles=80645acb-fff0-4f38-8529-f9a1773aa1c0 230901-0409=2639dd32-87df-4c8b-af25-f769a6bc2086 49 Neighborhood Store (Field Trial location)=3bc4da01-f3d8-42bd-b954-7bf4ca984bbb 2668N NC HWY 49=068e7fbf-da57-485f-8c05-c5f2b12757ea Burlington, NC 27217=af3ee9ed-c721-4284-b1a9-f4d6460e48b5 =5449588f-2d82-4ab1-90bc-539478436481 Arrived on-stie, checked in with MOD. I found that the issue was with FP 3 and the dispenser and CRIND are currently up and working. I asked the site if they gathered any oinformation or error codes when it was down and they only captured video from the POS. I asked them to try to see if there is an error code on the CRIND because Collin stated to me that when he was here there was an error code. He said that Invenco worked with him to troubleshoot the issue down to a contactless reader and they changed the reader from 3 to 4 and vice versa. they changed the USB port on fp 3 from USB A port 1 to port 2 and rebooted the APC. The problem returned on the same position so none of those corrections fixed the issue. Bill Workman has told me that they currently have a APC (UPM Portion) ordered for the site internally and should arrive next week. The site stated that it goes down every morning and usually comes up on its own which makes me think it may have something to do with 24 hour reboot, time configuration and/or hard soft or firmware boot errors that eventually will time out or bypass allowing the CRIND to eventually come back online. It would be worth pulling any logs and or configuration reports from the APC before replacing it. All test ok.
