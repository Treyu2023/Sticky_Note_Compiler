I put dispenser 8 in standalone and dispensed on all grades. Although they worked for me the nozzle latch was malfunctioning. I then had the attendant set a pre-pay on this dispenser & asked if they wanted me to replace the nozzle. I replaced the nozzle on FP 8 and tested. I monitored several customers using this position. All test ok.=2cbb1bb9-886b-41ef-827b-c75f2fe6576e =21983283-9da0-4ace-a75a-c4763c341e65 13.5 - 15.75 RTT (Rerouted and travel back)=19dc3bab-2501-4ede-b5a0-297d3eb1a6a8 15.75 - RTL=cf859172-c58d-484a-b8b8-ea14b37960d7 =e7212654-3578-49cf-aa83-e72c04c5846c =276bfb02-f5eb-4ede-89ad-efdf9b0cb808 VMS - 131996 =880360dc-6a25-41a3-a8df-91bcae81c8a9 PO - 189141750=32f5c369-f244-4447-a836-ced76d9d722d =b53235c2-cac4-4453-8ce7-e16a33b05980 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. The ATG had AE:8 Setup data warning. Automatic Event #8 was unspecified accross the board so I removed it clearing the alarm. The Panther box had amber lights on channels 1-3, power cycling the device cleared this up restoring fueling functions at the site. All test ok.
