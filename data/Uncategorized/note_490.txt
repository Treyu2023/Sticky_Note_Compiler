Subsequently, I initiated a communication with the Technical Network Services (TNS) team. Together, we conducted a thorough examination of the cabling connected to the Meraki 48-port switch. Despite an unexpected interruption in our call, we were able to successfully rearrange some of the cables.=0b6177ed-1860-4590-b2cc-e254dc5efdcc =1a868b07-f781-4ae9-88ac-0f91334e821c While further diagnosing the issue with the PIN pad connection, I discovered an incorrectly plugged cable. The cable was connected to an inappropriate VLAN designated for the PIN pad. Upon correcting this, and implementing additional troubleshooting measures as suggested by the TNS team, we were able to restore the functionality of the card services both internally and externally.=8d985bb0-eab9-4e1d-9aaa-3b68b7a925d0 =1f0ce09f-b397-43f6-a964-6fc2ddab791a I took the initiative to confirm the successful execution of debit transactions on both ends.

After approximately 20 minutes onsite, I realized an oversight; I had neglected to check in through the Facilities Management System IVR (FMS IVR). I immediately rectified this and logged my presence on the system.=1c5fa707-665f-4e3b-8e86-64a19763cc90 =2b036e99-05a7-496d-8ff7-1ea5f4b1eae4 My initial inspection involved verifying the cabling connection to the Commander port A2-7. I confirmed that the other end of the cable was properly connected to a Skyline box. Notably, this box is not interconnected with the same equipment that the client's handheld device is linked to.=4bcee8f4-31f9-4336-80ff-474b07e4b596 =0c547891-c98e-4d51-a5eb-6fedb7b51b72 In order to ensure the accuracy of the port settings, I carried out a thorough examination on the commander. The port setting for A2-7 and the device configuration for the price display were found to be correctly set. To ensure further validation, I reached out to our technical support at Verifone. The representative, Charlie, dialed into the site remotely and corroborated my findings.=971eae60-8ac5-4f4a-a426-c9e8dcebbb3c =e8487220-5b11-4613-bf22-26f83ad862d2 In a further diagnostic step, I checked the commander under the tools section - specifically under "Helpdesk Diagnostics" > "Forecourt." The system indicated that the sign had not been connected for 33 days as of today. Charlie, the representative from Verifone, clarified that the sign has not been connected since its last reload or replacement, implying a period of disconnection exceeding the noted 33 days.=07e6ea2c-ba1c-4230-8613-2becac7e9922 =df219eef-77b8-491f-8f0f-93999bc33e15 Subsequently, I had a consultation with Deep, who arrived onsite and initiated contact with Majors. We engaged in a productive discussion to align our understanding and approach to the issue at hand. We have collectively decided to wait for further contact before initiating any additional actions. For the time being, we are in standby mode.=9863861b-9918-463f-8215-e671f9e4028f =8a1da24f-f9d9-40bd-9f5c-ea92ce835a01 =452767dd-bce6-4621-911c-779d3a9cf799 =b32512e7-41cb-4ffc-8be5-727942334535 Please note the Verifone case number for reference: 08876063.=9a3f3954-a692-41e8-a883-72fec32501e0 Rep Charlie=c406153e-dcec-4261-a685-7ed140357871 VSID - 1488027=d25a2f37-81f1-45e0-aa72-e7ae74fc40da Commander with Ruby 2 Skyline Price sign interfacing equipment=846e3701-f296-4890-9d56-b509961115f5 =67036abc-40d9-445d-a7d2-1679c626369f Manager=c2177b37-40ee-48bb-a3ae-ea8b1408a4c5 G123456=63ef05e9-ad99-4332-a372-cc4d4d82aa8d =aad2ec17-a8f3-455a-969c-3942783c1aea =0e4d94dc-bfa3-48b6-96ed-e63f38f47ea0 =32f16bf2-a84c-44d6-8ca8-a2a2f0fa790f =2eb3d384-4a68-4ebe-9f23-61bd0d5512c4 =9ddff08f-33f6-4a6a-b5e3-319fadf0ca03 =827f3219-51f3-495f-bbd7-c4251d6a13b2 =d8b44e6b-cdd8-4254-bf4c-a3c6e3008838
