I had issues checking into SN due to password reset and could not reset password. I checked the BIR events and could see events from today, but when I checked the meter map it shows it's incomplete. I rebooted the tank monitor and tried calling no less than 4 numbers to which I was told to call 18009870711 when I call them and explain I am a tech they transfered me to the people who told me to call them. I tried reaching out to Austin Hott with no answer. Marking call as incomplete because I can't verify fix.=localId_f878ebe20f4048b3a31fee9be8bf5b2f =localId_eb1194c208264f62863d5a780b2ba29c =localId_a4f4f1febb274895bcbf49c0fea7781a =localId_ef2816183b7642e7a63f24c779cd7604 SS11-11.5=localId_0a658a6e544b4b52be77ad3f66b11ff7 134295=localId_8eff208bbc7d4cdd8158fbe3db5aa3ed FWKD3490374=localId_62045c2c26ee4f5b8c00469dbc58a1dd Already on-site, checked in on SN. The crind on fp 8 had a picture of a card with a x through it. I replaced the HCR and tested. All test ok. =localId_72f618eb58c5483bb8433f3f82d7f640 =localId_9a200a6a536e4caa8b3ced633a25ce6f =localId_62492473d8b84724b10f9a3288e102ba 11.5-12=localId_f19d6194aa08457b90a104c3ed784334 12-16.5=localId_0a290eb6b48840e596c0956cf43e2398 16.5-17.75=localId_54066a7a02974cf1b21b5f67ca1c2848 134318=localId_445c2fdd5a53480986202ff14a768ced 195407648=localId_809b0360b6d34d6b810152944fbd2392 =localId_43d14d9a6c6f4f6a94f2c30ac2b4eed1 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  None of the dispensers had power. I quickly restored power via the reset. While checking the circuitry I noticed that the dispensers phasing was not correct. The site has two rows of dispensers that correspond with 2 MAG VFCs for reg and diesel. So if reg on FP 1/2 and say reg on FP 5/6 were selected at the same time this would have essentially put 220VAC on the hook signal terminal for the MAG VFC. We shut down all but the outside 4 dispensers and monitored while waiting for electrician. No issues during this time. Eventually we could not get an electrician out today so I moved the dispensers to get a 2 phase setup. This will fix the issue with reg and diesel, but an electrician is still going to need to install single pole double throw breakers to get everything on one phase or we will still have issues with the premium. All test ok.=localId_73ba77c723ad4cdda06fdeaeb62c51ec
