I upgraded the software on the Commander and Topaz register. I set up import export utility on owners laptop and collected a backup of the system. The PIN Pad failed to update during the upgrade. I loaded 7.0.4 Viper pay software on the PIN Pad and confirmed Samsung pay and contactless were working in addition to testing credit/debit inside and outside. Once complete  I went over some of the changes with the owner and had to reconfigure pay out button to department from function due to secure user settings(requiring secure login for each pay out) for pay out function key. I completed the TRP CAP POS survey per work order.
