I copied the software to a USB drive and used that to load the software on the customers laptop. This allows them to pull backups of their RUBYCI. I instructed them on the procedures and created shortcuts on their laptop. FP # 1 was sowing CR02 error code on it when I arrived, I tried power cycling the UPM, then the whole dispenser. I re-assigned the card reader IP after that and it still was not communicating so I upgraded the OMNIA software. I also updated the software on both of the UPMs (using latest release compatable with EMV Kernel 3.09) to try and correct some of these issues. The UPM software updated force firmware updates to the Card reader on FP 2, but FP 1 would not take the update. Even though I was able to assign an IP to the Card reader, the firmware on the card reader is corrupt. I replaced the UX300 on FP 1 and the new UX300 immediately performed the firmware update once it came online. I activated the new card reader and tested an EMV Debit transaction. All test ok.=47f4a863-df88-440c-ba15-aa2bbcb506db =617fa1c7-bf9d-460c-a56f-5ba2c696a8cb 12.5-14.5 102 miles=f683b5b8-c624-4a91-b62b-13a64287e819 15-16=a51058b0-36a8-4fbe-a38a-646c5f7304c1 16-17.25 75 miles (actual 15.5-17)=638a984c-cba6-4598-b914-52945e2330c7 230103-0413=ec32a1ef-bdb4-4a64-9dde-bfd3a4766a9e Quik Chek #20=c76e620e-2426-4659-9c07-41ef6d1a32a4 715 Main St=07c903e4-986d-4cb0-8691-beda97592bc2 Oakboro=71121559-2a81-4761-86fe-1eeba879e166 =6a08e89c-87f0-4c35-b945-bee971401a4c Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. FP 5 was showing please pay inside when I arrived. I went inside and explained to the manager what the issue was and proceeded to reboot the RubyCI once no one was dispensing gas or getting merchandise. Once the CI came back online it corrected the issue with the CRIND on FP#5. I left detailed explanation with the cashier and asked that she relay this informaton to the manager of what to look for and how to remedy this issue when it occurs. I tested an EMV Debit transaction at FP#5. All test ok. =91604c00-15f7-418d-bae5-9cb8bcd36ee2 =9b2c7b58-0d0b-4784-a660-97fcc6e0f8c2 =91f009d6-0ee4-41eb-a773-143378b09cd6 =35ed8735-eb21-4e4b-a06e-754ff0c848fd =f90703dc-d3e5-4f03-b13d-3323af33b0a3 =310ad26d-7f94-4845-aabc-ece8809236f5 =be98e30b-357f-4cc5-97f8-95afdd7759cc =c31a7242-52fa-4392-8c17-491159b4a1f1 =31a880ec-1d8e-42af-8627-6692daaaac32 QC 8 Albemarle 5/6 leaking pumping unit manifold=5faaa321-ed27-4802-9336-4e45261f63c5 QC 18 52 S albemarle 5,6,7,8 pumping unit leaking at the seal=f95f74e0-c67d-4bd2-8eff-32363807aaa2 QC 20 oakboro pump 5 will initialize on its own and wont work=d6632f1e-8f72-45d0-8039-339d816a56f1 =99e2d012-3683-409b-9e9a-3eed0f30c7ef =ef8cb0ec-80a3-4297-924f-97e1778467a4 =0bc365a7-592d-488f-81a2-a653156da2c0 =4050b305-1e96-4f20-b659-9382315bfbf4 =ebfbf104-8f7a-4192-b7f7-d7db41cbffd6
