The manager explained prepay (Sach and card) issue which prevented authorization of dispenser. We replicated the issue, when the customer tries to begin fueling the CRIND is stuck on "One Moment Please". I rebooted the Wincor, EDH and Passport. I monitored site activity while working on second ticket and it appears to have corrected the problem. All test ok.=localId_15502c934431492b991d756a58a6455c =localId_b58f4457c15c44f6ae0a9405cb787635 SS12.5-14.5=localId_f8fca0cacc074f0a9b264b7131822902 137123=localId_e183bdc0c3e6436ba65281b36b1383fd FWKD4087409=localId_d740900edc444be4ad74450e1976ff6d 711=localId_64880a3ade954f05b68751ff0681245f 12103 Webb Chapel Rd=localId_aeb02fa0f35c47bd966d35a5543cad73 Dallas=localId_1e8cc6a095344c75840c6d7a85ec41cc =localId_56a63947bcd846bbb589a7994ce5c368 Already on-site, FP#7&8 I powered down the heater assembly and rewired the dispenser 2W to the standard wiring from the dedicated high speed 4 Pin connector back to the 2/5 Pin OLC connector and purged the CRINDs. I rebooted the EDH at this point. After this I went through the programming for both sides and found that the gateway was set to side A IP for both sides. I corrected this to point them at the SSoM. After checking everything over I was able to get a download, but the CRINDs came up to no card pay now. I rebooted the EDH one last time and both CRINDs started working normally. All test ok. =localId_0fafb64842f1426c880b0794d9b12b71 =localId_6412a07d8ffe4bfb8a7254a4b982281d 14.5-15=localId_40466c5b764341f691f70979e7accd1d 15-16=localId_fa375c7536054fc69119b2c80affe107 16-17.5 end=localId_e626e51b81144a078cbab65a878be4b8 137209=localId_33e790c4cb3f4f6a836d5d77ba5d68fd FWKD4096737=localId_e1b6aca93d5547ada69c7911d55c0f75 711=localId_7ceb4079a9f94400b1d16362a4cfe59a 9717 Webb Chapel Rd=localId_5db4ce8041604c029a1de9180646a91b Dallas=localId_e5346ac0a6594ac2bbec49a3f4560b9d =localId_99a21b6805fc4886909462558afd0e24 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. FP3 the CRIND softkey keypad is not working & has been keyed badly. I replaced the keypad & overlay on FP 3. The stuck sale and issue with FP2 were non existent. All work complete.
