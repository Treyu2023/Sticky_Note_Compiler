The register error was for initializing the Cr that was offline on the activation screen. On inspection the EPP(PIN Pad) mounts are broken on the CIM door and allowing the dismount sensors to trigger. I re-activated the sensor and made temporary repairs to the door until the CIM door can be replaced. I spoke with Jason Spurlin (Cockerham Maintenance) and explained the issue. He asked if we could drop ship the CIM door to the site to have his maintenance guy replace. I spoke with parts and placed the order. Placing call in Parts hold.
