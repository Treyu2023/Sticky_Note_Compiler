The proprietor's presence was required on-site in order to facilitate access to the office housing the Commander unit.=ed777e39-7e58-4984-a453-5408b50a0e78 =11b1369d-5642-42be-94fc-e3a241daa255 Following the appropriate protocols, I proceeded to shut down the forecourt operations. This was a necessary step before executing End-of-Day (EOD) procedures on the register. Subsequent to this, I carried out the automatic upgrade process, with particular attention given to configuring the network settings for the Enhanced Member Rewards (EM Rewards) program.=90adb0d2-fec6-4b09-8e51-d39ce0d709d3 =1fd8f883-9603-4555-83d6-399b22b83bfb After ensuring that all updates and configurations were completed effectively, I reactivated the site's capacity to accept card transactions. Further, I registered the Commander unit and accomplished the (CAP) survey, on the (TRP).=e05b2b79-875f-4881-8573-2922513c1e74 =e00abc1a-adf7-4ab4-9795-958de35baa40 Backups were systematically pulled both before and after the upgrade, ensuring that essential data was secured throughout the process. Following a comprehensive series of tests, I can confirm that all systems are functioning within normal parameters. Please be assured of my continued attention to maintaining the highest professional standards in all activities undertaken.=1c35f49c-3143-4934-9cf6-254ca7f24aea =06de504c-6a45-4b64-8d56-4dd7a2a1c73d =da4a4846-6e76-4316-a5c2-2ffe4ef00c40 =3dc0e667-d6b1-4236-a033-e4082266496a 12-14.5=b25fd525-6ce7-4948-90f3-f18e80f8ab18 230522-0216=c5ddcd2e-25bc-427c-b2b9-e39fb2626ff5 NC0023=170d9063-85dd-440e-87fa-2f79c7517c13 VSID - 1588845=aee1712f-ef47-47b2-9398-c370f2a325b7 Exxon=dab74689-2b97-48d4-a4e5-3181cd53612d 3028 W Gate City BLVD=c0612b8b-f7d4-4bc9-8782-9b2b23aa130b Greensboro 27403=bd839c5a-a6a9-45e7-9fa1-e881d3bef31c =28d78a17-b8f7-4492-9d29-a626a540dc4c FP1 - EN413952=c5479bff-266e-47f1-9e8a-f6079fe1e2db In- 03086422=8277a2b7-18f9-4135-bc60-4005d30a71e9 Out - 02373174=99580ec3-cb0e-48e3-a6b2-361955b0b044 =45c2bd03-8def-4590-9040-dd1e43a36c0b While performing upgrade on the designated site, it was discovered that the underlying issue with Fuel Pump 1 (FP 1) was rooted in the malfunctioning of the (UPM). This fault was causing an interruption of video power, thus rendering the Card Reader In Dispenser (CRIND) display ineffective.=8f37596e-4c10-4621-b0c9-44c436581b41 =8cf43317-6370-4fb5-bbd1-fd6e00168ee8 To rectify this issue, first I had a call put in by the manager for this issue. I then executed the replacement of the UPM and duly configured it. This was a prerequisite step before initiating the (RKL) download, as well as updating the software for optimal system performance.=f5699404-e73a-4466-aa7b-e2d3a99e0726 =61cd1d7e-026a-430f-aa34-39d9bb9c333c Once these processes were successfully completed, I carried out a comprehensive test involving an EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa) transaction on the dispenser to verify its functionality.=6aaebace-d9b2-4993-9418-687417dbef48 =e12ef38d-2555-4c8d-8ab5-cccd0f9f6101 After replacement of the UPM. I was unable to get the UX300 to aknowledge any card instertion. I conducted several troubleshooting methods before replacing the UX300 as well. afterwards I was able to test it.=92ffff3d-d433-420d-98bf-b0cae421a7ec =4d7751e5-91bd-46f9-8d98-517e5d9a3c49 In conclusion, all tests performed satisfactorily, reinforcing the operational integrity of the system.
