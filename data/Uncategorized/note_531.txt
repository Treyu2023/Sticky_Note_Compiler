The same time  Issue I witnessed at the mineral wellsite is affecting this site as well. I redownloaded the software from VeriFone installed the ruby 2 and loaded the fresh software. Once again the time would not stay stable. At this point I disconnected the 2nd register and set the time again. After 20 minutes I had not changed so I had the site before me end of day. This allowed them to take cards again. The only commonality between all these issues is my laptop. We need to return with a different equipment to load Register 2 again after the weekend.
