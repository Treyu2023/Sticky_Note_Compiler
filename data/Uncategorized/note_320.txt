Investigated issue to find the lid for the Premium Probe and the containment lip that supports it are damaged. It has cut the wire in two. I repaired the wire and got pictures for a quote and sent them to projects. I placed a trash can over the lid to avoid traffic damaging it further.=aab2fd7a-b183-4822-877d-0e0db570c4fb =34cfdfd3-08d7-474f-b6c8-4a1e000d69e4 =6020e220-900c-4bb5-b09a-f034b0748c2d 10.25-11.25 25 miles=0c2bcfc9-db66-471f-9edc-c903e8f49745 11.25-12=8a3c2991-ef40-46d9-9034-10562775c3b0 230418-0159=5394b025-fe7a-413a-8ef2-f65a04db4538 PO - 22999542=44eb0f9f-7713-45d2-982b-505db93eb0db Econo 14=2bc46bdf-081f-4ef2-8a08-51e5d5f5b894 2410 N Fayetteville St=b7641fd2-6bf0-4498-a6aa-f613f1ebdb53 Asheboro=534e0d63-9701-4894-adb0-ae9d1b4b46b1 =720cd58f-17bd-42fb-8cbe-6d68b0ea03f3 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. FP #2 I replaced the missing 93 octane decal and grade select button. FP #3 I dismounted and re-mounted the card reader that lost activation. I reactivated and tested the card reader. After finishing work the customer asked me to kook at dispenser 2 and stated that it was not dispensing. I tested the dispenser and found no issues.=05fc3453-5bae-4037-94e0-920815ec97c3 =a2a0ff5b-d9f3-4248-a3af-a0757fb7029a 12-12.75 21 miles=ccb91271-8f76-4684-9445-f4c2d152b31e 12.75-14.5=6f6f0891-93aa-4671-8950-bfdde7b36878 230419-0134=b266c142-55d9-4138-8b16-552ae7c44033 =2ad2b757-590f-47ba-860c-a4c9b696084b I have conducted a thorough examination and subsequent replacement of the card reader on Fuel Pump #3 (Equipment Number: EN00016266). Following this, I have configured all dispensers to enable contactless payment options through the CRIND menu. To ensure accurate timekeeping, I have also set the appropriate time zone and accessed the secure menu to synchronize the date and time across all dispensers. Lastly, I executed the BRCM tool from the back office to verify that all Secure System on Module (SSoM) components were up to date. Upon completion of these tasks, all systems have been tested and are functioning optimally.=ee61d2ce-50de-4484-9417-4152fa481ed7 =85ded1ea-df6b-4fc6-9d5e-b6e1fd8d8cf9 14.5-16.5 shop>home=1f2eba32-f1da-49a4-8106-918e49ca18d2 =82da4bf8-443f-4f98-958c-684236f8a0d2 =3541aea6-546b-40e7-b682-1c429ceac8ab =2571232b-2077-416c-8d89-18ae62deb66d =2e5fbd8c-be59-4171-9e00-8658719709ca
