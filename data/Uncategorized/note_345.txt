Reading the notes I conducted an alarm investigation and found both sensor went out at the exact same time 3 different times total, almost once a year to the day +/- 7 days. This is also the same time they had another subcontractor on site monday at 2:02 PM. I can only assume this is an anual testing. I conducted an inspection of the interstitial on the Reg and the Prem/Diesel (compartmentalized tank). both were free of water and or fuel and the sensors on removal tested good 30k Ω in the open position and 100k Ω in the closed position (+/- 3%) the cable while it was in bad condition at the surface pulling of the cable showed that in the interstitial compartment the cable was actually in much better condition allowing me to conduct my tests and re-install the sensor. The tank monitor was showing 0.96" or 19 Gallons of "water" in the Regular unleaded "Ethenol" blend fuel tank. I removed the probe and cleaned the bottom of debris as well as the floats while removing metal deposits from the magnets on the floats. after re-installing the water alarm went away. All functions normal on the ATG.
