I proceeded to investigate the issue on Pump 3, where I determined that the Card Reader in Dispenser (CRIND) required reloading. After successfully completing this task, I was able to process a debit transaction on the CRIND without any complications. Furthermore, I resolved paper jam issues in the printers for Pumps 3 and 5. Following these interventions, all systems passed functional tests and are now operating as expected.=66c77c99-f15c-412a-aff7-6c9ef31fd425 =d780fd0a-4630-460a-a3f8-84a540fd4b3b 10.5-11.5 45 miles=868f0f2c-3214-4721-9e62-c372d3514dd1 11.5-15.25=b7534c13-c1d6-4b6a-b008-6c454ce76c07 15.25-16.25 55 miles=517cf834-64aa-4a12-a088-2633d5efcd38 230421-0137=b605bf4b-9eb4-435e-a130-d105fe03460f Refuel Shell=42a94aad-d349-44c5-8af2-710389688c0f 217 W Church St=c6cc57f6-071a-4b4b-8262-d1242cb01ce5 Richland=8b59d130-02ac-4d94-ab19-9f19ba65d591 =565f84d5-b9d4-4d89-8094-c1097dfcd1ea Arrived on-site, checked in with Guardian team on site.

The Rubyci was up when I arrived the numbers scrolling on the side were for a otp. I rebooted the CI, Paysafe, switches and the register. Once everything was back up I had to contact Verifone and reset the managers password. I set it to "seven44" per the manager. Once in the CI I was unable to access the payment diagnostics with message connection refused. I contacted Paysafe (Case # ES104068) and they stated that they were not seeing any traffic from the A NIC.  With this information I contacted Verifone again and found that the payment controller section of programming was just missing likely due to corruption. They requested I reload the CI to remedy this. I pulled a backup and took pictures of what I could access. I got the software from another tech and reloaded the CI and RUBY2. Afterwards I followed the guide sent by paysafe to configure the network and EPS settings. I conta ted HPS and Citgo and got card tables and trigger pull. I tested a EMV transation inside and emv debit at the dispensers, All test ok.=fdffde60-2e16-4bc7-b18c-407c79a78d88 =920dd9c8-2622-47f6-af01-a95f47f764f3 On-site, rebooted Rubyci, Paysafe, switches, and register, reset manager's password with Verifone's help.
