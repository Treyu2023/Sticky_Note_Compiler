I was able to successfully restore the internet and then proceeded to replace the MAKO box with the new one that had been shipped to the site, as the Sprint sim card in the old box was no longer functional for their 4G backup. Although the provisioning process was lengthy, we were eventually able to get the new box up and running. However, we encountered connectivity issues with the Dover box, so I directly connected its internet connection to the modem. In order to do this, I had to obtain a USB to RJ-45 adapter from the shop. Upon my return, I connected this to the Verifone zone switch, which allowed access to the commander. Additionally, I changed the IP of the tank monitor and moved it to this switch to enable simultaneous connections required for the Dover box to access tank readings. I also renamed the DCR KEYs in the commander and reloaded the CRINDs to restore the softkey buttons. After thorough testing, all systems were functioning correctly.
