The reguster was working by the time I arrived, the Manager stated that the site is still having issues with the regular intermittently pumping slow or not at all. I could not duplicate tbe issue. I replaced the STP relay in the Red Jacket box. I did this for both reg and premium, both were in bad shape. The Premium was sticking on.

The site has several cables cut behind the desk, some of them go through the wall to the register. One was a 9 pin Serial cable between the back office PC and the ATG. I repaired this cable. I ran a new cable from the EDH to the ATG and also replaced a cable going from the Cybera (front) to the juniper switch (back). Afterwards the manager was able to poll the ATG from the Back Office PC.
