I checked ATG for leak rates on Diesel Line/Tank. I checked all fueling positions for tampering in electrical/hydraulic compartments of each dispenser. I also turned on one dispenser to pressurize line and checked each of the diesel nozzles without authorization. Ultimately I discovered zero evidence of faulty equipment or tampering. Tracks have been covered. All test ok.=localId_2da01c8ea3d44842aec8cf8718e60443 =localId_fcc12e2ea21649c4b623ba5b17e92964 10.5-11.25=localId_01df1d0b671640b8acd4eeee48f5a4db 11.25-12.75=localId_8ef2b2f726b2475f851fda6d7dcf31cf RT 2308=localId_1a2bc2f4ac12466d89af6b14e694a523 Project=localId_89e07000a2784da581d924c3a94aacdd =localId_0159920cbd914d00b664d07a96a088c1 Arrived on-site,  worked with Elliot from RT to iron out issues with nexgen/dispenser connectivity.=localId_99280e510b6f40fa9f06d9467eb21923 =localId_b9ea0c74508b433d900a2ec78709c34e 12.75-13.5=localId_1c10116467974dcdbff38a4602e8a17d 13.5-14=localId_5d5c31ee3f6f4658af423444bfe518dd RT =localId_89cbe93639724f6cb1152c3c48bb261e Carbon Rd=localId_c704bf4ce15742c88eb590dc8456c31c =localId_be56d73631d2458595c88a4da71d8962 Arrived on-site,  worked with ST to correct the B20 PLLD issue.

The power port has become detached from the dex device and is attached to the cable. I contacted 711 HD and Dex team and have been told that we are supposed to provide the replacement dex device. I forwarded this information to office and am closing this ticket as incomplete for now pending parts, so that I may resolve other tickets/issues I currently have at this site. =localId_6a7082ef5ab54446b63dbef2f33fa5d7 =localId_98128d8ffaf248a6b190216a7324d82b 16-16.5=localId_46e7e2df21844a36b7cff11bd84ab487 SS=localId_839b559ad99e430aa90172dcca472e5b 135367=localId_b1106cf8b2e04f078628a9fa4189676d FWKD3769365=localId_756559664e53443eb6be425e0eff5242 =localId_264be148524d4974857da1d6a696a54a Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.
