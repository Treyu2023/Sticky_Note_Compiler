I traced out the cable to port 40 on the cisco switch and tested the cable (good). Port 40 on the cisco was not lit. I moved the ethernet cable from the PIN Pad module to the berg connector which lit up the port but remained offline. I ran both cables directly to the PIN Pad removing the berg which also lit the port but without bringing the device online. I was unable to contact NOC due to unusually long wait times. The cable is good I returned connections to the berg connector, verified port activity and completed call. =localId_5221f16327da4ec19b942afa03ebf723 =localId_6b1c8b70625c44aab60917339d4415fd =localId_4fb7de5ecb6d4f54a830c354599d9ee0 =localId_b3b5c1a0beb941ff9473460423e6cc78 12-12.25=localId_5c978c5e1d8f48e49397950cca49c051 12.25-13.5=localId_9900dcd8971e4b349c92a8f37cb49da2 137301=localId_3cf4ea9ab48c44b1ab5f65e6bae5bc2c 204974150=localId_37016c2aa682436aaa0ec35a34b79dab RT=localId_d9c669701f29435c88341332a253bf6c 220 W Euless BLVD=localId_e58834ca89914b9b90114bec34128581 Euless=localId_5f56baf565414e1284f437417308e8e2 =localId_5ae18cc7dcf44b02a4463c57d172c63c Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. Fuel was operational on arrival. I ran tests on all 3 lines. The 3.0GPH history showed 2 failures today where the motor did not run. I ran several tests on the Reg line, but couldn't replicate the issue. The STP Amps looked normal. The Red Jacket relay contacts were very worn. I replaced & tested the Relay. I monitored site for a bit to ensure no issues with the Relay.
