I replaced the RV042 router with a working one. The passport was still unable to run SQL dependent standard recovery procedures. I was able to locate an Image taken at an upgrade on 4/20/22. I restored this image, unfortunatelt this was only able to restore all drives including the backup drive which wiped the report information between 4/20/22 and 7/15/22. Afterwards SQL was working and I was able to restore the snapshot taken before the image procedure. This restored the system minus the backup drive (D:). The FP 5/6 is offline with no power at the dispenser. FP 5/6 & 7/8 share a breaker. 7/8 have power. An electrician should look into power issue with field wiring. I performed an EOD and explained the situation to the Manager. Somehow the snapshot did not restore the fuel prices to the dispensers, but the price sign was accurate. After opening the site we had to configure and send prices to dispensers. Cleared backup mismatch on the passport. Site is 100% operational with the exception of FP5/6 at this time. All test ok. =localId_f5cd4d0aad1742598f5977e6c7698af3
