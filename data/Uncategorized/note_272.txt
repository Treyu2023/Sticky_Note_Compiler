Tested each grade on FP#5 (No Bags) and they all worked as intended. I spoke with the manager about this and he explained that this call was roughly a week old. I think this issue is a pulser orientation problem after a power cycle. I explained what to do to fix it and the manager mentioned the E-Stop. I think the E-stop may have been triggered causing this issue and triggered again before I arrived which essentially corrected the problem. I explained what he should check for next time to see if this is in fact the issue and what could be done to resolve it and/or where to get the error code if the problem should happen again.

Found Diesel 2 MAG-VFC was completely dead and smelled of electrical death. We had the breaker on to it when we reset the E-stop and it tripped within 5 minutes. We replaced the MAG-VFC. This site like Camp Bowie has a power conditioner fed from panel D and which is entirely feeding panel C. The same .5 phase inconsistency. We moved the Breaker for the ATG to Panel D.
