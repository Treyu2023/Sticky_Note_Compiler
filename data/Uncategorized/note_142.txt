I rebooted ATG and EDH. This didn't seem to correct the issue. The TS guide led me to anomaly in the meter mapping. I contacted VR TAC and brought this up, the Rep dialed into the Veeder Root and cleared the map. No meter events were reporting to rebuild the map. I rebooted both devices again. I contacted VR TAC again and they told me that the EDH is not sending data. I contacted GVR TAC passport and also contacted the manager and exxon. But I am unable to obtain the Security Manager Report, without this or the admin password to reprint report no further work can be done. All work Complete.=localId_10b78a77be374d2dad361be9aad7c8a0 =localId_22e7aa1defee4585a1c9cfb2d13c9d70 14.5-15.25=localId_9a40832ae5c04548ae2659517d41a8ab 15.25-15.75=localId_96b51541f8964ca98be10d50f12cd954 133082=localId_5f639ccd215544a4bb47e90e300273cf FWKD3283094=localId_6a1b20bf3d5b4196805a9c84d76da9d2 =localId_628e0371d8d04deb9f729668956fed11 711=localId_4402a03d3154434e98143403624806f6 3602 S Lancaster=localId_49e8702a68ae4d0d91ee028644589062 Dallas=localId_e70ba30c14db43c786fe1785e4f39c6b =localId_678923c8c357460380b976f2e0b9fc1e Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. The nozzle on FP 1 looks like it was recently replaced. I tightened it 2 or 3 turns and asked site personnel about the issues and determined I was already replaced.

Both of the NEC registered pinpeds are having issues with cards falling out and reading EMV chips. I contacted systems and was told to close the ticket, that they would escalate and send parts to the site. I'll test OK.
