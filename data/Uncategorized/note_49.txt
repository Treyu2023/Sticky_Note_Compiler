Lane was not closed so I had to wait to shut it down for servicing. Once I had access to the fueling position I tested it sccessfully. Although it works its kind of dificult to manipulate the nozzle correctly. I spoke with the manager and informed them that we had ordered a retrofit kit to replace but we were asked to cancel the order by David Freshour (Loves Maintenance) who had his guy come out and replace the cradle like for like. The manager stated that the issue persists and is more dependant on the customer than the equipment. I explained the situation and suggested we just re-order the retrofit Kit and upgrade the obsolete components.=edcb5ab6-125d-44f4-ab16-eaa17ad3581b =13383d5c-62ad-4257-a1b9-9c0b5494cfa0 =a4d2e2f9-6122-4019-81f1-bc432904fa10 david freshour=5928a289-8052-4f23-9226-2cbe2e335c56 =e1577905-a8da-48c9-9b8d-d7c8d8e6fcd7 =181627a9-f02f-40e1-95bd-2f941dfcecda =a91c739a-06d0-4f15-9d2a-ff3226b60ee2 11 - 12 Shop=f102839f-31c4-41a8-845b-cc9f78c77e94 12 - 13 RTT=4741d455-3a54-47a7-916d-c0399f193088 13 - 17.25 RTL=a02f36bd-121c-48d4-b300-0575f0e20566 17.25 -  RTTDH=f5b2d3f3-df1f-4630-905b-10bdcc2deb49 =d0fd468c-7d68-42cd-8ce4-923dc6f95f7d VMS - =9e1c59b2-0b99-47de-b40c-42b603644ffd PO - 185922911=56a3ef54-bf2d-4ecc-b4ab-e8cf0b2921f3 =86b91c58-c248-4fc6-8fc8-2b6039c9bc50 RT 2435=fcbce7e7-83e0-4fdf-bb2f-82ab8b61ee86 720 E Arapaho Rd=c810ffb1-fe8f-4b8a-8008-78a02dad6c21 Richardson=5e4aa788-0ae1-4502-983a-db885f867e10 =9486f74e-e922-4e82-8572-9b794ced4300 =d1b8be8c-38c5-4773-a058-a83128485548 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. Mark T met me here to assist with pulling the cables from front to back. we located and isolate the suspected bad cable which had visible pinches in it from where they routed it through the floor remodel.  we had to uninstall parts of the floor for access and replaced one cable with two leaving a spare. I was able to get all the devices back online and viewed customers using the self checkouts. we used roughly 225 ft of CAT5E cable in the two runs. All test ok.
