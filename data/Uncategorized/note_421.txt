I investigated the issue and found that at some point the price sign equipment in the back was replaced with wireless equipment tht no longer has a port to physically connect to the POS or the Price sign. The new equipment does although have a handheld device that does work to change the price sign (I tested and changed the price with it). This is not automattic due to the fact it does not connect to the POS or modem with existing cable connections. Port A2-7 is configured for price sign. This was plugged into the old equipment, the transmit and receive lights are showing both for POS when I powered the equipment using the power cable that currently was powering the new equipment. The connection cable on this device going to the price sign was bundled up and not plugged into anything. There is a power adapter on the wall that looks like POE equipment and is labeled for signage. When I hook into the available port on this device I still get no receive LED. When I trace out the other cable plugged into this device it is plugged into a modem in the server rack. It apears to me that the issue is with the price sign and price sign equipment. I spoke with Deep the owner and he stated that it worked when the last tech was here but stopped after the tech left. I did some research and this was not one of our techs. I suspect the tech used the handheld device to change the price. Further troubleshooting of this device can not take place until the site has proper equipment installed correctly to communicate with the POS via Serial cable connection using Price Sign vendor provided Interface connections. If the site is connecting this device to the modem and not the POS then it is not a Verifone/Guardian issue and the price sign installation people would need to troubleshoot this any further.=ea8cc6c8-8136-40d9-bb5c-f496c5d80441 =f0ee3769-2f77-4da6-9c4d-de57c60fb415 12.25-13 27miles Shop (Lunch)=eb502b52-143e-4db6-8bfc-c34141a32329 13-14 =0dfe7481-500a-4f19-8172-a2a86cabbcc8 221219-0164=0048a547-9af7-415c-ac02-82061ea3fab6 broke down and drained warranty C+ meter for shipping=bf659697-5338-4e57-af09-92a4f5941164 =27d7eee7-68b8-44aa-9ba6-87522aa11045 14-15.75 75 miles=40ea2a9f-cab3-427f-abf8-219f637283fd 15.75-17.25=487c80cd-2aed-4159-a17c-717c7d3cd27b 17.25-18.5 65miles=0447c76f-23d8-4d82-81b0-729fcb18a9cd =d444d068-0a3e-491a-8ed0-a06fef00abd0 230103-0341=c0de8b97-21c5-4c05-a2fb-a77667c1c97b Quik Chek #8=3599968b-5709-4442-ac0e-5b5289474870 627 NC 24 27=c8f40197-0fb5-4314-9667-1c267578dc86 Albemarle=067a91ca-20b6-48eb-8a0e-5d0354492277 =d04a3718-66bd-4154-9f5a-ad9d026c8605 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD.
