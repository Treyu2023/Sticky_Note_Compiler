Also had to replace a blown fuse in the Electronics cabinet. Once parts were replaced we tested the operation of equipment.

I was able to connect to the RUBYCI and pull backups and initiate an EOD. The software the site was using HPS 1.13.40 was much older than what is available from Premier portal. Since the backups were pulled from this version its very important to use the same version for compatability reasons. I was able to get in touch with another tech that had this software version and had him send it to me over the internet. Once I got the software I reloaded the RUBY2 and this corrected the issues. I monitored the site for a moment to ensure e erything was working. All test ok.=0699cd41-d148-4749-9264-d5f01a69d643 =4eacd580-6668-4470-9acc-0c54be9d5b6e
