The Manager mentioned FP 12 was missing a screw on the nozzle cradle. I replaced the damaged gasket and the PIP3 on FP 10 (EA00017323) I then activated the CRIND dismount sensor for the screen. I was able to remove the original screw which was still in the cradle but had been stripped out with a larger screw that tightened the fit on the threads. All test ok.=5ab3c1a2-e07c-45cf-8ce9-9f2ea969b99f =eeadb8bc-45c9-4797-85dc-1e1200af389d =e04c2bfa-c3dc-4d5c-b3e5-4f1858b91890 10.75 - 11.75 RTT=1b2c13e8-61bb-4ea4-adbe-5253341abbbe 11.75 - 15.75 RTL=88ee1a47-2777-4e28-9136-4dc60479e7d7 =e3b8f45e-4885-42ee-8bfb-64ea0a39603b VMS - 130649=73266b7b-0951-43dc-a890-8669b09bad83 PO - 182350339=75935248-3af7-4851-ba8e-bee3d21f17d3 =5ff2e787-f58d-429e-b025-a2de0bd031f2 Arrived on-site, checked in with SC and MOD. Briefly went over what happened to make sure there wasn't any new information. I found that the E-stop circuit is tripping still. I I located all 5 E-Stops (One is in a box near the back of the building that looks like it can be accessed by the fire department. I asked the manager and she does not have a key to access this box) The E-Stop and the Reset at the counter I found to have faulty wire connections which I repaired. (This switch was previously moved in a remodel of the counter. I located the J-box under the platform floor but its only a pass through with no connections i it.The switch at the tank pad when inspecting looks like water has gotten into the switch but there is no signs of water intrusion on the inside of the box maybe it was rained in while open at some point. I remade both the connections in this box due to corrosion and when turning the switch back on I had to repeat the process several times. I contacted dispatch about getting this switch replaced and he in turn is sending the information and picture of the switch in question to the RSM. Closing this ticket.  =937343f0-6552-44a0-8dd3-aa96a5b9b695 =686f8a54-cbb0-40c4-a3b5-44f73cca1ff4 =dcf23276-5751-4925-9afb-ac4134ee5326  =71039cae-0551-4c53-8bb6-6816dfc38c31 =f4904ffd-0e1a-4cb7-8211-de49a5bcb3d8 =47eb750a-abac-4db8-95a6-c1502527210e
