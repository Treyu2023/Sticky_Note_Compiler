The Card issue at site is confusing, because everything is showing online as it should. The internet box looks good. I rebooted all equipment in the server rack and tested cards multiple times, but nothing corrected the issue it seems like a network traffic route issue. I tried contacting GPM and got in touch with Marcus who provided the on call techs email. I reached out to them but received no response. I spoke with manager and we decided it would probably be best to return tomorrow during normal operation hours so that we can get the assistance we need. When I returned the next day to install the PIN Pad on register 1 I was told that after the day close the cards started working again, closed ticket.
