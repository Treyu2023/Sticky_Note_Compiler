In order to access the power bay within the TLS 450 Plus, I initiated a power shutdown. With safety ensured, I restored power and commenced troubleshooting and part identification.=0bc191dc-4c12-4ab1-8b30-00760f5aafa7 =e4394911-cc85-47ad-b84d-6372c1b30227 In need of specific parts, I contacted our shop to arrange the necessary items. I then took a short leave to retrieve the parts from the shop. Upon my return and the successful installation of the power supply board, the Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG) became operational.=3fe4fe99-a8ba-42d5-b752-18d2adcd34fc =795f6769-a6e4-4e1c-ab67-912e742bdcd4 Following this, I reinstated the dispensers' service and monitored the site's operations to ensure their smooth functioning.

The initial investigation suggested a leak issue on Fuel Pump 7, with both the regular and premium lines appearing to have issues. Despite my best efforts, the precise source of the leak was elusive due to its small scale, even during dispensing.=9dca44ac-124a-441c-af4a-26e62c94c1c1 =a7e4b48d-f03f-4a39-81bc-9cb89db9b673 Notably, there were about 1-2 gallons of gasoline in the dispenser pan's bottom, with the flex hoses appearing damp. There were also drip marks on the meter sides, but most of the gasoline appeared to be residue rather than fresh.=b56bf047-ac81-461d-8731-eccc9b0b9156 =dced7b99-b257-434f-a535-0ccc3c91edeb My tests on the mid-grade line, aimed at pressurizing the system, did not yield any detectable leaks or identify a precise leak source. Consequently, my assessment remains speculative based on the observed residue.=fd3ce504-73d8-4153-8e85-2f9679c68cc7 =698b52e2-ec4d-490c-b7f2-bee08f0f5931 In light of safety considerations, I decided to turn off both shear valves and placed bags on pumps 7 and 8. This action aims to prevent customer interaction with the pump until a resolution is implemented. There was a noticeable gasoline odor, suggesting a gradual accumulation over time. The issue is now pending further inspection and resolution. All other checks concluded satisfactorily.=fd50c714-4653-48fb-8268-d6be110429d7 =667e1439-88ed-4ddc-9d5f-5d6756303a1b =980b7244-0fd9-437b-8482-e563e1e0ad1c =0d82de6c-bdb8-47b3-8b7a-048ad6bb972d =35c94380-56b0-463a-b3d6-f1e45f1c1412 =f04925d8-5003-42bb-b9d4-628e56f121c6 =e84fda11-1eb6-428d-8f6e-cbf862562dad
