The printer on FP 10 by the time I tested it was only printing vertical lines. I replaed and tested the printer. FP#20 was bagged, I asked the manager about it and he stated that it was bagged due to a leak in the hanging hardware. I tested fueling on FP 20 and checked the hanging hardware but could not detect a leak anywhere with it. I unbagged the dispenser while I did paperwork to watch customers but was unable to reproduce any leaking condition. All test ok.=1ca131fe-b52c-454e-b04f-3d9728f3f02f =c6594908-e2a0-4588-aba2-19a6dd209890 11.75-13.5 45+24 (69 miles)=c4f6b6c2-fd77-437c-a04e-912bc67f9dea 13.5-14.5=a60b48e0-5a86-4b99-84cc-0e0fc82490fd 14.5-16 61 miles=c860c7d7-e888-435b-8267-8ec7a7f830a9 230119-0090=a7f5e084-263c-4d11-ab1b-f65198462db0 PO - 233554826=8734e5ef-888f-486d-9554-c682491764e9 Eagles #9=966f2723-70dc-454d-af21-ac5ca0ab8b8e 2301 US 220=2e95d3b5-ecae-42b9-b02b-084223c393a0 Stokesdale=cf2c9582-a4d4-42ec-b5b0-c42123839a52 =d27fb701-afb8-4a64-8bdf-207bb4f1f523 Arrived on-site, had some issues checking into the IVR Service Channel App. I spoke with the MOD and replaced the grade select button on FP 1. FP 1 was saying Pump Closed on the CRIND display. When I asked the cashier if it was stopped from the register she said no, I purged the CRIND on FP 1, I asked the site to reboot the EDH when they are not busy. It appears 1 and 4 both are having issues with CRIND communication. All test ok.
