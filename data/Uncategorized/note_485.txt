The site server was offline. The plug to the Sonic Wall was loose so I tightened it (probably why RTSS couldn't dial in) Several of the dispensers were showing pump busy on the CRINDs. I rebooted the Panther & purged each of the affected CRINDs. The registers showed stacked 0.00 sales on man positions. After rebooting  site controller I connected a monitor and keyboard and saw it was up and online. I contacted RTSS and explained the situation with the Sonic Wall and the stuck sales and SS was able to get into the site controller and clear put the stuck sales. I tested a card at the dispensers before placing forecourt back in service. All test ok. =localId_84eb5b473e034fc3b4cd9871e3026ef1 =localId_1996139f056a45ef9fde691495de431d 20-20.75=localId_0fe898a9e2094d6fa3b54d046c65edb0 20.75-21.25=localId_b82fed5334d74590a96a8ed6f8e6c00a 21.25-22.25 ottdh2=localId_e86aaa7a87174a05b08a3bf350e6118b 64521773=localId_009194742d224b35861a38b36726d1d6 EZ Mart=localId_acf898c2f322457780e4f778dfe5109c 3080 Mayfield=localId_3cef743f5d7a44de9c1d16fc477ade6f Grand Prarie=localId_eb0ca7398a8744b1abf51ac86489a9b6 =localId_5cfc20fc48764b7dbbb5713ca7506ef6 Arrived on-site, checked in on Verisae and with MOD.
