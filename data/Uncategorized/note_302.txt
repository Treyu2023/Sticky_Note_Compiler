The system was unresponsive and remained on the white startup screen. Despite attempting to reload it, I was unsuccessful. After consulting with Verifone technical support, it was determined that the system's memory was full.=76dafec1-7cc5-4fb5-9cc9-101f755ca327 =22cfdd46-9d69-4c58-aae3-108da69b3be0 To rectify the situation, I initiated the system's diagnostic mode and conducted a RAM test, which prompted a memory rewrite. Consequently, I was able to reload the register and reconfigure the scanner's baud rate. Additionally, I created a backup of the Configuration Information (CI), shared it with the manager, and addressed any lingering questions.=82c93005-3728-4781-bce1-182a88614c09 =1cb678f4-8b90-4bc4-b4ab-411fa654739b Finally, I tested the system's EMV card transaction functionality and confirmed that all tests were successful.=5be50944-1d91-4b2e-a836-4055b492671a =584b94d6-120c-4927-bb61-21cc128fd992 =f2da869e-63bc-4654-a15b-d50f6b1f61ec =24c8cbc2-e148-499d-af36-c5f06de1afde
