The sensor for DSL1 East FP 1-10 STP sump was showing a value of 0 resistance on the ATG. The sensor was triggered by the presence of water in the STP sump. I was able to remove the water & clear the alarm (<1Gallon). I also cleaned the lid seal for STP sump to try to prevent future breach of containment.

The Passport software appears to have glitches. The screen hung during store close procedure. I was able to start a new till and restore fueling functions. I was able to print the report it was hung on from the 17th telling me the issue was only with the graphics, because the report process completed. After starting new till the report screen remained in the background until I rebooted the register. I checked a few things and ran a new shift and store close without issue.
