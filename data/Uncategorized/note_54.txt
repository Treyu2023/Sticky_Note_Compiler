I ran a line test on Q:3 premium a few times. I opened the dispensers and monitored fueling operations while I continued to run tests from the ATG. The flow rate of the regular is about 3GPM. The Premium was failing one out of every 8 tests dropping as low as 11 PSI in under two minutes. The Premium STP is in a 2x2 ft hole and is 3 ft deep making replacement dificult. The regular filters need to be replaced so I contacted admin team requesting parts to make repairs. Due to timing issues I went to the shop to retreive the parts myself. I returned to the site and replaced the swiftcheck and transducer on the Premium grade STP. I replaced all of the regular and premium filters 6 total. Afterwards I tested each line and monitored fueling operations for a bit to ensure no other issues. All test ok.=833aa056-03d1-4a70-bc43-44c3df3e3827 =e3025731-7c91-4818-90b8-b92e35946fdf T15-15.75 30miles=cd6aff8f-8201-4259-a00e-63346e0ea6d9 15.75-16.25=bdf2c633-01a7-4aef-89e4-279fde648e06 16.25-16.5 10miles=345cf8cc-eecf-4466-963e-27f36eb24016 221227-0444=50c3352b-23aa-4965-a98c-db6cfde66772 Quick & Easy #12=2705c852-8884-4d9d-ba24-57145f09775e 8112 Hwy 64 East=7a1f3ac2-4615-441d-b37f-2c205f49c5ce Ramseur=a4cb1496-2ced-45de-8824-c9075a15ed0b =7b9c0f74-4c98-4051-92b8-ef270d5bf004 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. When I arrived the Card reader portion of the dispenser was still without power. I traced the issue to a jumpjack connection on the Trail high voltage connectors. I was able to manipulate the plug to where it would not turn off when I tried to replicate the conditions. FP 12 came right up I had to purge FP 11 before it would return to normal state.
