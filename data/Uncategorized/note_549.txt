Initiated an investigation into the reported issue of water in the Diesel tank. Confirmed a presence of 1.75" of water at the probe through both a paste stick reading and sample pulled. Inspected the tank top fittings - all appeared secure.=c44295b9-3adf-4fe7-a751-d344b56bc1f8 =b64900f8-3347-4d02-ad65-c9124ecb8aa8 However, noted that the Diesel fill is located in a low spot and tends to accumulate water. If delivery drivers aren't removing this water prior to refuelling, it may be the source of the contamination. It's also worth noting that the adjacent lot, composed mainly of gravel, has significant standing water near the diesel fill point.

Attempted to install a replacement NOI display and cable from truck inventory and even swapped the dongle with another device at the register. Despite these efforts, the issue persisted.=9737535e-42f9-4a2b-bc53-c1c16d71aafc =fecb5cd5-ea81-472b-913f-b873853fe483 Contacted TAC for further support and they remotely accessed the system. Through collaborative troubleshooting and application of known fixes, we decided to change the port to the mat reader port on the PX60. This solution rectified the pole display issue. Post-service tests conducted were satisfactory.=2f0365f3-0b64-4161-9e89-60499f8ccef9 =4ee5d8ce-3628-4ada-bee9-d9186c9e4701 12.25-14 Oil Change=f9f7b1ee-e00a-4527-8920-bf240cb55a22 =5a7dab03-fae8-40cc-806a-5191ecd0a715 =4936e45b-d1b1-4ac5-8354-6ca2bb696bdd 14-=069c5288-44fd-4a30-b2b1-dd2d2675122b =55e96f59-cbee-4957-ad8e-2cfe5cbaa036 =4de68ce8-2174-4241-b8d6-f63c2f15ce16 =eb2d7aed-5ef9-41bb-a3b0-aee2214289e7 =65be00e2-f2f4-4aaa-9fc6-700b8fb7cd36 =9a07c34a-13d4-47f6-bd9a-9a046712cd17 =726030e7-702d-4e5e-ab7c-7b1a3195d73b =bb5ebfbb-1c1d-48ad-aa9b-4123d8fa7a5e =10bf28a4-3dbd-45cc-a5e4-8012f7c69ead =df430e00-f723-47a8-8fea-7d9676275a43 =51f19489-5206-4060-8bbe-f578874fceb8 =aa8889fe-d478-41c0-965f-f39bbe3c8b0e
