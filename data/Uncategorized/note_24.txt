I contacted Comdata to coordinate the necessary support before shutting down the forecourt or removing any existing equipment.=c5e76726-1769-40ab-a28b-b5f94a097686 =dab88cbd-5abb-4c7b-a1de-6bb2b03d87cd After swapping the NexGen and allowing Comdata to configure it remotely, I verified that all dispensers were online. However, after running a sale from inside, I discovered that all the CRINDs (Card Reader In Dispenser) were offline.=a25dec7d-3647-4f7d-a058-e989886df8b9 =7ef2b573-df96-469e-af0f-e9a6ed3ddcf9 I reached back out to Comdata and began troubleshooting, including rebooting all related equipment and verifying the configured external IP addresses in one of the dispensers. During the call, we quickly identified that the issue was due to port 6 being configured on port 7. After moving the cable to the correct port, the CRINDs began taking a download.=166f3475-a675-40b5-8ad5-13e4b5e6aec9 =df16dde8-59cd-40d0-a4ef-da6cabdf371d Once the download was complete, I conducted a test transaction with a card at one of the dispensers. All tests were satisfactory, and the system is now fully operational.=265a375b-5143-4749-a4c6-0c9660136c85 =c98a28b9-5788-4123-a670-bc3ca9972640 =e66c9b5d-f87e-4b61-8141-50d32fbd45df =943d1961-f8a8-4ee9-936a-f7cba153391a =f71d30a5-20e7-4710-9687-ff6333c716d4 =f166d8e6-8539-4a5f-beb6-2b1dcad09ba0 =61a11aaf-2bc3-4998-8149-f752c68966a1 =f015e6b0-c66e-498b-91e8-691eb99bc6a0 =d4c64ed9-dc12-4e00-bb4e-ec16f4e03583
