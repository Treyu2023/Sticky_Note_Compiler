The manager explained that they had power related issues a few weeks ago. This issue is not related. I checked all of the breakers. And traced the issue to one of the e stops mounted in a high traffic area that's missing its cover. I was able to get the site operational but I am ordering a replacement cover at the request of the manager.

I tested a card on FP 1 (HCR) it worked correctly and the dispenser was not bagged. I tested dispensing on FP 16 and FP 7. I removed the bag from 16, FP7 was dispensing slowly because the breakaway has been reconnected too many times. I replaced the breakaway and tested flow rate.
