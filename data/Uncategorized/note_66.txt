Register 1 (not used) the site connected a new scanner with the cable plugged in backwards (not sure if it matters but this is a powered port) and this register was not getting past topaz screen on boot up. Register 2 was having issues yesterday pertaining to the card network which made things run slowly and this made it appear as though the register was locking up, running slow. This issue resolved itself. I reloaded register 1 and configured the scanner to work. I then configured an additional scanner they had for register 2 and got it working with ID scan enabled.i then gathered info for site to use to contact the network and identify the site should they experience network issues again. I left this information on the ticket and with the site.
