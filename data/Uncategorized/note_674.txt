After reading the previouse tech notes full version in Email it seems like the configuration was checked and a trigger pull was completed but they were unable to perform a card table update because the site would not let them close the day during the tech visit. I spoke with the cashier this morning and he reached out to the manager to let him know I was here. I checked settings in the commander and didnt see anything configured incorrectly pertaining to the Contactless EMV. I reached out to Citgo and had them flag the site for a EMV PDL as well as a card table VIA Trigger pull for VAPS/HPS (contains card table) I contacted Victor and asked before closing the day and performing the EMV download. I noticed in the system messages that the card table tried to pull last night at 10PM unsuccessfully. after discussing with the site I found that this is when they do their end of day at night and close, however, after this process they log back in and open a till to leave the drawer open to avoid vandalism. This process has been stopping the table from downloading every day since it was flagged prior to my visit. the Card table pulled automatically when the end of day completed. I performed the standard initialization of the tables initialized drivers and EMV. Rebooted the CI and the dispensers and performed a download to DCR's. this did not change anything. I reached out to a couple of other techs to brainstorm and performed many checks referencing the Release notes for the software they are running VAPS 1.12.40, the software running on the CRINDs 42.12.45 is multi kernel and multi platform eliminating the need to reference the correct one (PU-GU passport-Generic) (as well as the correct EMV Kernel) the software is known to work with Citgo Contactless EMV sites. I was told by citgo that the contactless Credit transactions are giving an error on their end of trying to process as RFID (this should change with the EMV to the NFC option after upgrade) and it is only happening on Credit contactless card and Credit Google Pay. Debit works in all varieties. Contact EMV Credit works fine. Site also has working applause media. The Owner Victor stated that the software was upgraded from VRSD and no tech performed the install it was just a message on his register and the auto upgrade triggered after closing the day. Later I found evidence that may not have been the case. Printing the upgrade summary it stated that the VRSD was rejected because the version was newer. it showed 1.12.40 trying to upgrade to 1.10.51 (base 51 variety with old screens) this conflicts what victor was saying as well. After a while we ttempted another fresh table download taking into consideration the previouse download failed countless times before saving the file completely. This was followed with the same procedures as before and netted the same results. I reached out to Verifone and worked with William (Case#10204836) he showed me where the config client reports>site asset data>dispensers were showing the CRIND's 1-8 as having software version 40.5.2, this however was not consistent with the printout showing 42.12.45 software so I tried to connect to the CRINDs from the BRCM and that is when I discovered that this site is serial and not COIP. The release notes from VAPS 1.12.40 do state that this will work as long as the wires from the BRCM ethernet to serial converter to the DCR are twisted pair. I verified they are in fact twisted pairs. I connected to the CRIND at the dispenser and ran the M7 software compare tool and verified the version on the DCR's is 42.11.45 at which point I reached back out to Verifone and explained the situation incorporating my lack of COIP and Applause Media and was told the software referenced in the config client was pertaining to the UX410. I ran out of time but need to reference the procedure for upgrading the UX400 software. This may be the fix if this doesnt do it the last rep I spoke with George stated that the software would be the next step. No one could say wether the serial connection with applause was not the issue either. there are limitations in place there that probably werent tested when the compiled the release notes. will need to research and return with a plan to upgrade the software on the Contactless UX400 modules. =6e8f41b5-c565-4140-984e-475e9d6ab101 =bf8ebdea-ec01-4a54-b1ba-4d4bbdc59753 =75532426-affb-4c72-a395-fbd73bcf691b Revised GPT - =1cb70d2c-9129-492d-85b9-891d39ea9be6 PO - 26064558, Champion Mart, 8913 E US HWY 64, Thomasville NC, 27360.

Issue: unable to update card table during tech visit due to end-of-day closure issues. Communication with Citgo initiated for EMV PDL and card table update via VAPS/HPS. Discovered card table update failures linked to nightly end-of-day process interfering with download. Resolved by ensuring card table update post end-of-day completion. EMV initialization and system reboot executed, but no resolution. Consulted with techs, referenced VAPS 1.12.40 and CRINDs 42.12.45 software, confirmed compatibility with Citgo Contactless EMV. Identified issue with contactless credit transactions processing as RFID. Found discrepancy in software upgrade history, conflicting with owner's report. Attempted fresh table download without success. Verifone involvement (Case#10204836) revealed CRIND software version inconsistency. Discovered site uses serial connection, not COIP, checked for twisted pair wiring compliance. Software version verified as 42.11.45 on DCRs. Next steps include UX400 software upgrade consideration, pending research on serial connection limitations with Applause Media. Further action needed to address potential software upgrade for Contactless UX400 modules.=b12b29ca-2da8-48ed-898f-c2f1321c3e89 =67148d8b-42df-42a6-84b9-6f485bc6d02c =c23233bf-ffc0-4e40-aae1-817d72a403ed =5edd9976-42e6-40ae-a2f7-f0d59def6e1c release notes VAPS reference=9efc1cb6-d2e8-43a7-83f9-cfbf5a40099b =1c6b2312-183e-4974-88a2-7bbe5ba53ceb possibly downgrade software=6deebe47-1195-44b0-b689-cb81bd977fd1 =7c673a8a-939b-4c29-81af-760a90ea5c14 try a fresh table download from Citgo=b84c6167-cfa5-4e26-9d6d-6a54d0b6ec19 =fe3c6e01-0773-4b01-9c15-32fd7d436c1c MID - 00015060056=2b5a49ca-76a4-4441-bc05-26a6de85d208 VSID - 1722179=0bfea0a1-30aa-4a98-80d5-4081a5edf38e VFN Case #10204836=96624ab4-bc0b-4a7e-8209-502c7a820cc8 William =2fd1ae6f-36fe-4a2a-be14-1816ee19f9ce =edd551b9-6b1d-4490-bd11-5925eb5419ac reporting/site asset data/ dispensers click one to see their version to the software
