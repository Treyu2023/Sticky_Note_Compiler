I pulled dispenser logs from 1&2 and found only one error that stuck out on may 2nd (EC4314) This pertains to sid eB high product no flow. The site is equipped with ECO meters. I then put the dispenser in standalaone and ran tests to find that it was acting like dispenser 1 and 2 were not turning on the STp. Even caused a gross line fail on Q1 Regular. I called for a =second man and together me and Noah traced the hook signals, STP Relays and the E-stop circuits. Turns out it was turning the STP on, but the Relay (Isotrol style) that was installed in the Power Integrity box that was feeding the Regular STP was working but buzzing. We swapped the relay with the Kerosene and this corrected the issue with the buzzing. While rebooting and putting dispenser 1 and 2 in standalone the EPP on FP 2 went into a tamper state causing us to have to replace and RKL it. Once completed we monitored the sites activity for a short time to ensure everything was operating smoothly.All test ok.=6314a9b5-6d33-42b1-9674-91cf358c63bd =4d8a1aca-4d5d-40f8-af72-be113113a843 14.75-15.5 35 miles=4bf41b28-024f-47ee-8976-33cdfdb97e82 15.5-16.5=2985b924-1663-4195-ab06-3b33ef4aa3cf 16.5-16.75 15 miles=3e8d8bd1-30e4-4c81-bcae-0ca4f4d03b47 230623-0286=8250e293-7b56-4273-8c0d-3c8a2bd4382b 127 E Swannanoa Ave=852c2a01-b3fc-4a8b-9839-439395553439 Liberty NC 27298=93128f7c-987e-4e9e-9d2e-3cf1720bd4ac =e7c79953-fc43-465e-b7ee-3e8c5455b1d0 Upon arrival, I engaged in discussions with both the site manager and the owner via phone. The exact issue causing the communication failure of the PINPad on Register two wasn't immediately apparent. However, after scrutinizing the settings and rebooting the system, the PINPad autonomously resumed operations. The site informed me that a similar issue occurred with the PINPad on Register one the previous day.=ae1784df-8771-406b-a37d-0984c0b982e1 =786f231f-3871-4ff0-b9f8-3456232bed80 A problem was reported concerning day close procedures. The site had been instructed not to perform a day close until 10:15 AM the following day due to a day close having already been carried out at 10:15 AM the previous day. This instruction was meant to prevent accidental double day closes. Despite this, the site performed the next two day closes at 2PM, which resulted in the system repeating the same warning, now suggesting a day close at 2PM.=739e16b5-dacf-4b5e-bfeb-b0adc128066d =b94f0086-835e-4286-9eb5-f15695d9909a Furthermore, the system displayed messages indicating transaction stoppages. Recognizing this as a known issue, rebooting the Commander resolved it. Once the day close is performed at its regular time, the problems should be rectified. All tests conducted after these procedures confirmed everything was functioning correctly.=5c0703ef-cd57-41f1-90c4-b157b3c7d5d6 =fa574e06-f20a-4aac-b3c1-22ee468a769c =ecb481b0-d378-4001-a1c2-edab83b12fe1 =d7104f3b-8a12-4c5b-b452-20c217c5f471 =99f5c47f-e194-4ac8-8af8-c842f8bac9de =60b088c8-c84c-4b81-9203-37f4b94f9e3e =0777d3af-ac1d-46fd-b3c2-bc0bc634b25e =726d0ba4-21d7-42da-9bed-e263bad99d52 =1f943dfb-e41e-4dd7-9fad-3d8ccdead372 =320e2380-979a-4b4e-8a01-8ef51bebc11c =70d93521-5aac-4238-bc5f-65c88237ba4f =da658a4b-963e-49be-9484-1a201e7c1fbe =5e582bd2-6d85-4859-828b-91129af25b9f
