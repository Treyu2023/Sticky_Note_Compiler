Pulled samples from premium tank at the probe access using water finding paste. I cleaned the floats and probe components. and detected no water indicated by the paste nor from visible observation of the samples. I used the probe to sweep the bottom of the tank and then I re-install the probe. on checking the ATG there was now 0 water showing in the premium tank, but I noticed and discussed with the manager that the Regular tank was showing .66 inches of water. She gave me the green light to look at this aswell. I performed the same procedures on this tank and concluded the same results of zero detection of water both with the paste and visual observation. All test ok. No alarms on the ATG at this time.=10c8b1b7-4a3f-4504-ae70-fc378433546d =219770b7-f8c5-45d8-a5e5-218196e5247c =fbb2a22f-501f-40ee-bd1a-dd06827b11fe12 - 12.75 RTT=e664d99c-53ae-423c-88d4-a0e8e5bfe95112.75 - 15.25 RTL=b57788af-c71c-49b7-9423-b6f7a7561138=d8bcefb5-8fa6-482e-a30a-f1e9521a0b92VMS - 131252=9e3d49ee-ad7e-487c-aff0-adb6984f622bPO - 184674819=fb45c726-3f67-4e2f-bf83-e40ad0bf7399 =5e589a2d-69da-4647-9cb5-024593517decRT 2337=c0796552-b6fb-4401-8f7b-652962bc30652807 W Northwest HWY=f0b86dd8-c949-4abb-9dab-613f7d31a261Dallas=91d00b33-f96b-496f-8035-3070cdc077de =631cb89d-2923-465e-ba4a-786777dc06d2 Arrived on-site, checked in with SC and MOD. Investigated issue with FP #1. The electronics cabinet door was missing the receiving portion of the lower hinge and was only held on by the lock and the top hinge. The missing hardware was not to be found anywhere in or under the dispenser. I fabricated a new receiving portion and installed it.

I checked the usual entry points and noticed the vapor recovery adapter and cap look rough, but I dont think the water is breaching here. The STP sump is full of water. Once the VAC truck arrived we pulled a sample from the tank that showed roughly 8" of water and 2" of E10 fuel. With these ratios we had to evacuate the tank to not potentially cross contaminate a delivery with phase separated fuel. I removed the Mechanical leak detector to suck out the lines and the copper tubing portion I believe is where the tank is taking on water. Additionally the functional element is missing parts that seal it (while this is an issue its not likely where water is getting into the tank because this is a positive pressure area connected to the line) When we removed the water from the sump to drain the lines the VAC truck had to constantly remove water because this (dirt) sump is filling up so quickly. After discussing the situation and coordinating with parties involved we collectively decided that the best course of action is to have the vac truck return in the morning and have a HMS tech meet him here at 10AM with the forementioned parts and filters should they need to be replaced. I was asked to email Mdalton@gpminvestments.com with a repair ETA to schedule a fuel delivery I have done so with 11AM being the earliest time for delivery to give them time to make repairs and remove any water the tank takes on between now and then. I have left the breakers to the STP's turned off so no one will try to fuel and potentially kill the motor by means of dry run. =ecff3bd3-49de-42b2-a0c0-c2b65840a7b0 =b3e2f066-860d-4506-8b7e-f5ed2b56de82 =af4612d9-5eea-489b-9fc2-59eb2d7cf694 =6865a4a9-2a9f-40d3-876e-cb49d757e29f =43b7c05e-a856-4488-b9d4-dfb786d26fd3 =fe3f5555-2de1-4504-9c68-0172711102bf =a28fed61-f796-4036-8c25-345006631bb7 289.53 DSCVR=b48d2fa2-43ba-41a9-b96f-89d2f0035d55 600 RH                  889.53=fa634b5e-21a3-4c09-9737-2ec23ee200e1 294.67 CAP1         1184.20=8bb10d23-99b1-4855-8462-1e2dda29014e 439.03 ML             1623.23=7839c8b3-eeba-41b2-a93b-b057bcc0e188 36 WFCC               1659.23
