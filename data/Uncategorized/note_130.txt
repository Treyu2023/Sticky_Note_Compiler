The seriial card initially was not registering as installed in the ATG. I reseated the card and re-initialized the cards it was seeing. after rebooting I was now seeing the Serial card in slot 3. I moved focus to the Passport and checked the configuration. I then checked the tank levels before and after a sale at the dispenser and confirmed I was seeing a level change. I contacted Passport TAC and confirmed that these readings are coming from the serial connection in real time and not from sales data captured by the passport. All test ok.=482e349b-6693-4a37-8df9-42b2c1ff238d =2d8efe16-9288-4784-9453-e855c5bfba29 =9178dfbe-ce01-4caf-92b3-70abd2f0fd3e T12.5-14.25 75 miles=2fb97243-2f73-4c4c-9ec7-477412483de4 14.25-17.25=4b4fb36f-eb0c-4979-8bb2-f7ea65714b35 T17.25-18 48 miles=d85353b6-7efd-4ba0-b449-043ccd5e0e26 221019-0121=56aaabfc-cf38-4557-85be-e848314f803b Sheetz #418=15f818c6-5b1d-4794-955a-836a023df204 5905 Finch Farm Rd=b30a69e5-1a1a-45f8-9871-007320cb23b9 Trinity NC 27377=12315806-d128-43ea-89f7-6bc0028102f7 =28eb813b-9f12-4bc6-aee9-ba2a23f91622 Went by the shop and grabbed 2 PCN that are suposed to have older software for NF6 dispensers. Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I downgraded the door node software to 2.0.59 before installing the PCN with 4.0.66 software on it. After installation I was now able to set CC 90 to 25 (NF series specific setting) this allowed me to proceed to calibration, I calibrated all products except for the E85 and the 88 octane grades as these two would not dispense. I believe this was the original problem and we are just now getting back to this. I redid the programming and calibration and flipped the blend ratios between 100 and 0 as well as swapped the valve plugs to ensure I tested all configurations and got no flow on either side for either of the forementioned grades. Since we are getting into overtime we are going to return to correct this issue during normal hours. placing call in NCO status for now.=b3f6d673-f111-426e-ac78-ff96c4126ed5 =92e54470-2858-4b91-98ef-e0734f619e26 =6b24b6c2-bc60-4175-86af-68e3f052b17a =2f3e8b6c-099c-4f1e-9710-f3d3117f3e45 =577c221c-6978-40e8-aae0-e1db61f98ae8
