As per standard operating procedures, I adhered to the playbook guidelines, successfully executing the system upgrade.=6585190a-4d9a-435b-b9b7-c55525ecdb63 =497990bc-c40b-4a97-8d5c-65808f13d181 Challenges arose with the VHQ and Insite360 systems, as both were unable to register successfully due to an external connectivity issue. These issues are noteworthy and will require further attention to resolve the existing networking difficulties.=24e125ce-0e82-484d-898f-bb1e7617280c =958bccc9-6d1a-4a86-b597-036ade9399ae Despite the aforementioned challenges, the installation of two lift systems was successfully completed. It's important to note that to facilitate this installation, I had to utilize six Zmodem cables from my personal stock.=e83f11b0-1031-4d99-b603-040c822dbbe3 =77205ada-dc6e-434a-a1e0-d59d4e413917 Conclusion:=dd0e2f27-2fb8-495a-8a9b-4fff4b11a1da The on-site visit resulted in the successful upgrade of the designated systems and installation of the lifts. However, issues with VHQ and Insite360 remain unresolved and necessitate further investigation. All tests conducted on the new installations were successful. Future action is required to resolve the connectivity issues hindering VHQ and Insite360 functionalities.=32965579-36be-4918-8689-bccc53c3ad4e =39c9ab43-0262-462f-9eda-a4cfadbd1f37 Before leaving the site the manager brought to my attention that with 16 fueling positions it has bumped the payment line on their screen to a swipe screen which makes processing transactions have several extra steps. I sent an email to the tem at RSID@Circlek.com and was informed to have the manager contact the normal helpdesk to resolve the issue. All test ok.
