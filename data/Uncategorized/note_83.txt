The manager described the issue where multiple FP's are intermittently hanging on "one Moment Please" during transactions. I was able to use the CRIND when I arrived, but this issue has been frequently affecting the same FP's. I replaced the UPM on FP 3 to see if this will reduce the frequency of this issue.

The dispensers had no power when I arrived. Fp8 had the nozzle missing and the swivel was damaged. The E Stop was broken, but still functions. I was able to reset the E Stop and point this out to the franchisee. I explained that I would need to order replacement parts, but the e-stop is functioning. I put the nozzle back on FP 8 and tested for leaks. All test ok. Will return with parts for E-STOP. =localId_9f44e8cd01da4741ac0217c2c28ebf35 =localId_3fd3f4dd87f64ef48ab66ea30ab739e1 17-17.25=localId_4b394fd3baeb45bda2e05c26a5ca3ffe 17.25-17.75=localId_cb7434acf6bd4c96b61ff186764ab8fb 17.75-19.25 end=localId_7c303acdddd344fbbfbfcddda9851730 137Duncanville=localId_b05ec00a94c44bbcb5731badafa7edf9 =localId_1c209e1eb98343579d5691be71201e49 Shane Turner=localId_fb9746e2729f429d9c1955b103f9946e RT=localId_97eee0bb142c4f7ab4d76b44bbfc100c 519 Cockrell Hill Rd=localId_ba7c328360674fc7a305229fd00e373b Duncanville=localId_0599d5acc2814b3099a90ea4f8ba7806 =localId_443dda2508ea45879560def192a49428 =localId_b10f2104ed5241e1b86eeb6d8c553aa1 Arrived onsite, checked in on SC and with MOD.
