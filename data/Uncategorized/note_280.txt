Including re-routing the Dispenser communication in pass through mode from the BRCM to the Tiger box. I had to reach out to Phillip Jeffco the project coordinator for RT. He got me in touch with the Implementation team for the NCR/Tiger configuration. I checked into a PO with SC per Ron. to add 15 minutes to and state that they are getting new dispensers today=2285db58-d634-454d-875f-e6e65d6b4a9f =b80c3604-8fe8-4b20-914d-9e3cdf5e050d =789ce289-4492-4d12-b9c3-9699e9f7fa30 Ed - Daytime=364c3dc8-9d51-40f8-a076-e8e2bedeae5f Scotty - Evening=90747432-0481-4412-9cf1-b6d02b249b49 =28385005-0512-4fc0-89f8-eca523637230 =e70fbe8a-0fa3-4b6d-9011-fb838582020f15 - 16 RTT=136a562a-1732-4bb4-b2d6-8fe1398bacd716 - 19.5 RTL=2b6c53f8-8a11-44fe-bf48-e28d4a0e0cd819.5 - 20.5 OTTDH=3587f00a-9ef4-4421-9147-36fd695a50f0 =95f30904-9814-4f45-ad41-e1611e4a41e0VMS - 130418=67292822-9dbd-4e11-8a29-ee396a5ca599PO - 181342796=57e47e15-94c5-4d52-8df2-c027e2be0c13 =784daba8-50d3-42c7-bee4-909c772158652834 W University=2b8b88be-05d6-4958-b944-36c54b4654efDenton=c3eebbc6-0974-4f40-9e6f-916bf1d49079 =1eddbffa-68c3-4f87-aa4b-9f9b0cc4f7ec 2 Products down (RECALL)=b67d2cfa-0066-49fe-8693-567208a3a440 =c5452b4c-3cbc-41cf-8b38-8e3029fa7093 Arrived on-site, checked in with SC and MOD. I ran several tests on both Q1 and Q5 with no indication of any issues. I printed test results for both lines and showed where =b874912b-da30-4433-854f-a84b38217653 the motor was not running by running and test pressures of 5PSI. I moved Q:5 configuration and Wire termination to Q:6 slot at this point I got in touch with the technician that was here ealier and found that the site had E-stop tripped earlier. Now this made perfect sense. I checked the E-stops outside and inside. The one on the left side of the building looks worn but the 4" box with the Estop mounted in it on the right side of the building is not secure and can be moved in and out fairly easy which has compromised the weather proofing of the connecting cables. I believe this E-stop is likely the culprit if it isnt a customer triggering the E-stop. The Service Channel notes stated that the line could not be enabled due to tests aborting. This was likely caused by the handle signal being on when the test was attempted which results in immediate abortion. I explained this to the manager and showed them how to avoid this and re-enable the lines themselves. All test ok. =24513e39-0553-48af-aa87-e2d008f19c4a =5947c52f-a42e-4ba3-9653-974c6cd69fa0 =75b4077f-110a-4aa6-af62-41e4be5c5c1c =ce1caa4c-a4c4-4826-96c8-53708dfe0a17
