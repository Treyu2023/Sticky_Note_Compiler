Fps 1,6 and 9 were bagged. 9 worked on testing. Fp 6 had 5047 error code in the mid and premium PPU display, I was able to power cycle and test this dispenser successfully. FP1 did not prompt to leave card inserted, so I purged the CRIND and no change, power cycled dispenser, I had the dex box reset. After none of this worked the cashier had mentioned they had always had issues with this fueling position. I checked the UPM programming against another dispenser and found that the screen predictor was not turned on. I tested again still not working I purged and rebooted the dispenser again before calling 711 Dex team. After he tried a few things from his end I told him I was going to reload the UPM software, it's at this point I noticed the software was different for each side of the dispenser and some of the TLS certificate hierarchies were missing from this UPM aswell. I upgraded the software to match the other side with PCI5 software 52.11.47 (up from 42.11.22) and contacted GVR to perform RCSH download containing the missing hierarchies. I then rebooted the CRIND one more time and tested Debit EMV to find it is now working.  =localId_4acca7fbcd0f4bfa9727cad16deadf10 =localId_fabd3f3e2bc543be8f609c9548d023da =localId_9420c4318d3248cbbed80e50d8c8cf83 12.75-13.5=localId_9da6593836374986a065fc93d6dbb737 13.5-14.25=localId_ccdce7ca21d54188a4dc65b3b70b88d7 =localId_02bf4018dd2b4f3baaf7f54b556854ca VMS 132652=localId_c08d4cbac7da428b9944d0350f56a126 PO FWKD32146965=localId_697fdb5def3048c09b2912123e555566 =localId_f6074d402f1e4cddaa420efb7abab158 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD. FP5 was equipped with reconnectable breakaway, but it was damaged on separation. I asked the site for parts before replacing with parts from my truck. After replacing parts I went inside and re-enabled FP5 from the register. I had them preset the dispenser so that I could purge the air and test for leaks. FP5 DSL was likely INOP because the dispenser was closed on the register. All test ok. =localId_a93c9422eed749438b481119d1969d66 =localId_0817446556414b40a40b1fc1d053addf 14.25-15=localId_7ce4b01b56e443d2802b737d005b75ca 15-15.5=localId_95316ec276f74c4c92abf83a6fe3ffe4 =localId_4cd1e1f06f784a0a876107b371212840 =localId_05ee5c3657964ed3bba74365767be05f VMS 132542=localId_69e0536b7ddc4d17a7632e0e3a268309 PO FWKD3196101=localId_1b7a1563c0f14d4dbff2218c71416b41 =localId_1fb99c3569cb47a8b2eaae7916a87b8a Arrived on-site, checked in on SN and with MOD.
