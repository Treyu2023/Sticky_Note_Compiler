I then replaced the PIN Pad and configured and loaded the required software. Upon completion, I attempted a card transaction on the PIN Pad, but encountered further issues with network functions being unavailable from the console, displaying an "EPS unavailable" error.=9048a335-c38c-4ce7-8b47-b55a4c2e2994 =3bab1af8-4a6b-4927-8856-23b36bc2aafd To address this, I rebooted the CI (Commander Interface) portion of the register from the side panel button. The reboot seemed to progress normally, but stalled at the A8 status on the panel display, and remained there even after waiting for 25 minutes. This A8 status indicates a state typically seen in a new unit before software is loaded or possibly a hung boot process.=7a2c3962-4f11-4227-b69b-0c6146140e4f =27a42e52-d502-446f-bf85-57f73d50cdc9 I then powered down the CI and Ruby 2 via the power brick, waited a minute, and restored power. The Ruby 2 booted up normally, but the CI returned to and remained at A8. Since there's no information that can be obtained during the boot process for the CI, it was unclear if the process was hung or if the software had been dumped. This condition necessitated a reload and/or replacement of the unit.=7ae8149b-047c-4528-8b38-e5e472ccd8b5 =268af984-d186-44a8-adab-83ca8528d8b4 A Field Service technician arrived from the shop with a replacement unit, and together we replaced the RubyCI and configured all the peripherals. After testing transactions both inside and outside, everything was found to be functioning correctly. All tests were satisfactory, and the site is now fully operational.=04a9546e-029c-4366-871e-ce72d5686668 WEB-002695648=78cdef04-f876-48d4-8619-f332dae2e7a5 MX915=8bce95ca-4f99-4892-8bfd-3473b2e3aacd IN - 262478-965=17a8ec5f-8126-4ad3-b031-d949206da918 OUT - 804-612-427=72fa1d27-4353-4438-b616-f5ee3e116586 =deff5295-8eab-4c1b-a452-35d91559b9cb RUBYCI=1e92c72f-f4ac-45c4-93f0-fe4ecc0a2842 OUT - 216-386-746=500f1b15-c9a1-49bf-929c-b5e9f02bb74d IN - 216-283-026=17409e34-79f1-4bfc-96b9-8e0220c4354f =ff01de99-629b-4ea0-a02f-07573061a98e 510.30 - MX915=3e27afa5-cf60-4732-b80b-556972c0de3d 50.00 Exp Fee=8e26856c-fbff-4f2e-8cec-b6bc1b6f0099 15.00 Key swap=9afcf074-c270-43a8-8f42-d402860f5efc 35 miles =9fe423f3-e456-4921-a4fc-48c23a7e062a 1+1 Travel=2fc38793-1de0-4f11-8984-8a5d7d436d4e 5.5 On-site=fb875adc-c631-4761-8a5e-b5b8976f4a78 =ea06a58c-32e1-4b0b-8aec-b6746439959c =e5fbfaae-4507-4514-970e-62938da5e7a4 =c135d034-a3ea-48ba-86b2-3995b8a4977e =94157663-c74b-4009-b8a8-8f7d0cba0493 =ae379662-9a1f-4dc8-a31d-b63ba3db50b9 =b0eecf6c-4c48-42c8-a362-ad19f313631b =8270f52b-2385-42dc-9adb-5fc752ff3d39 =256d165f-f02c-4eb7-b33b-6ae4cc2c4fea =6a5a10f8-21cc-4e2c-91ce-51f890317e49 =ad44f7bb-37a6-4bd0-9329-f6dea02771c0 =0c6d450d-256d-4719-883a-dae4d90faa56
