I checked and tested pressurizing the system. After going over the incident with the manager I found that the diesel shear valve was tripped. At this point I called for a second man. Once JM arrived we disassembled the top of the dispenser and found where the leal was on the Diesel product piping connection for the hose manifold is cracked and the piping was ordered by another company. After showing this to the manager he stated for us to close this ticket and let the original tech parts order complete. All work complete.=localId_956de82f13ef4cfd980bdc9eca4a5f73 =localId_8cb1f073fc324581b9964f6e11bf2d4b 14.25-14.75=localId_dd9a8bb5cdc7499db1dab22063269b5c 14.75-15 75 shop=localId_2ab6e013af834e2aaaece4a7733ace13 =localId_defdb13ead9f4ada99d07a3fac65819c 15.75-17.25=localId_69f37dd58d7e4f2cb47d7097c1795471 17.25-18.5 Ã—end=localId_248cf7a11346466c8241a72a60f613cf 138320=localId_88516b13dc3442a4ad4b30922580132b 208558536=localId_c1b7f18713a54a499291b68963382b04 RT=localId_d689c227bd764dfaa1faeb675b6bf70f 7001 BOAT CLUB Rd=localId_fe73a210dfc54c83b69ea8415bc2f7b8 Boat Club=localId_1d76d2cb2c174c9ab796424926a14bb6 =localId_fa6a0ff1190547ebb08ead010a314846 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  The register is booting into windows and applications boot. The ethernet cable is showing traffic, but vnc app is unable to connect. It seems like the issue is with the NCR register itself and will require NCR Tech. In troubleshooting the cable I did get the registered to go past the VNC message, but afterwards it still got only to the green screen no further.
