I troubleshot and repaired the connection to the report printer. The Receipt printer on register 1 is working fine. Register 2 is not working and can not work with this configuration. The printers the site is using are only utilized with the Passport Edge system (EOL). I was able to ping the IP address from the server but not from the client. I spoke with Cybera and they could see traffic on the virtual port 9100 coming from the client printer. The rules in the Cybera only allow for communication between the two VLANs that originated from the Server. Previously this would have been the case as the passport Edge clients were merely portals to the Server where as with the new configuration the server is now a Server/Client Combo (still works due to coms link originating from the server physically) but the second client is now a standalone machince without egress rules to communicate between the two VLANS. GVR is not going to support this configuration due to the use of EOL equipment. meaning the sites only option would be to obtain   standardized printer/network topography. All work complete. Mike the owner is working on obtaining a TM-88 printer for the second register. The error message the site was getting about Insite360 encryption SMR-1 was handled by GVR by re-registering the site with Insite360. the rep stated that if the problem persists they would have to disable the feature until the issue is resolved.

I was able to access the CI and get a backup. The ruby 2 portion is dead and will not allow me to reload the software on it. I can not check the inventory at the shop currently. I spoke with admin team and we discussed with site personnel and we determined all things considered the best course of action was to reconveine in the AM after store opens with equipment to make repairs. will return in the AM.=56f74def-3d78-4491-b497-f7d7dd2c4af0 =6ede50c1-6552-40d5-9dc7-fc4c22eed745 Buypass 3.10.39=c76cadfc-1e3f-4175-8931-2bf74d8c85f7 =81713813-5a0a-4666-acb6-8ecf0303c0b1 =48e08f39-a4df-4861-aafa-d6dc8988800d
