However, the visit was complicated by extended billing discussions and additional support tasks. The situation was escalated to the service manager for resolution. Technician feedback regarding the customer interaction has been noted for future assignments. Once it was settled the customer got admin to reduce the cost of the UPM to what Raleigh had sold them one for which was roughly 400.00 cheaper and I wasted an hour and a half waiting that is not billable. Eating ito the profit generated from this call. But the customer did write a check for the updated amount.=cc5d0c40-43b1-4706-bb35-87917b1908d6 =88a9ac89-19aa-4a92-a8bf-f1efc75e0603 =91098014-1a45-4264-a71a-902955b21efd =bbfa3f30-e3e3-447e-a207-316f5fda25e8 2028.72=8a1d85b3-3885-4554-ad1a-0f0d9a94b279 =ec2b7759-4591-46a7-95ee-ad971be2f645 13.5-14.5 30 miles=ff3edc49-91b3-4cdb-b867-c10c1fe808f8 14.5-15.5=7e7f0cff-3064-4916-854e-f94c9d435789 240110-0089=ea5db5f9-6c93-4930-8023-d7e3ebf88c13 Quick & Easy #8=04b95270-bbdf-48cd-96eb-be911ff91ac5 4191 Old HWY 421=8f12366f-3045-4847-aeb5-f423704157d3 1836 Elmer Moore Rd=a8801c72-acda-410d-b681-5969cbf131ac =bb99eb4c-549c-4280-898c-8a436da16913 =b0ca34cb-efee-4ff5-81e1-8277b40bff0e Field Service Report: Touchscreen and Register Troubleshooting=96c33c1f-e923-43d7-a9be-d00e34d18e51 =2ae23b6f-a0dd-42aa-940c-51ad2a26a933 Date: 1/10/24=696c6c79-3861-4781-85c1-29e683dac3b7 =26edf712-4885-42dd-9e48-d94374bc37f2 Technician: Ryan Key=ec799839-e683-4489-acff-9fa61284e875 =63c02da7-cc80-4b49-addf-cb1f8c0fc3b6 Site Visit Objective: Address and resolve the issue with a non-responsive touchscreen at the site.=56117bfa-e816-4c8c-a2a8-922fa67ffcd9 =5ab5e236-759c-4b19-8033-9cd9de443ec6 Actions Taken:=0b44b15b-b85f-4dc2-877b-bb35dd33f2ee Initial Assessment:=318f03b7-6d54-4d19-9845-508cac578076 =175209f3-9ca8-4bd3-8a1e-9f6fb7e6718e Arrived on-site and confirmed the issue with the touchscreen not responding.=45bb44c0-4831-4b46-9f2a-69600d6b4d54 Troubleshooting and Resolution:=403251d7-8180-4fd5-8848-654df08bcedf =f5d19588-c667-4c82-95c7-fb17f39f5053 Executed a reboot of the touchscreen system.=38971bbc-b7bb-438f-8f25-7775e394c064 Reloaded the register following the reboot.=e623b1a1-03d9-4650-8527-a0d285de139c Successfully paired the reloaded register with the Commander system.=2b72c8f2-461f-462a-92ee-d31c77083ab0 Operational Testing:=8e7fb492-60ad-4d1c-9c7e-923e499f952c =039add1f-0091-444c-9a0b-7a345ce8102d Monitored the site's usage of the register, ensuring they could scan items without issues.=5aefa4ae-e1d3-4bc6-84e4-81f7d1da2b6d Completed necessary paperwork while the site personnel tested the register.=c2fcdb6a-ed7d-492d-acdb-3789aafb42e8 Conducted a final check with the site staff to confirm full functionality before departure.=2f148f4d-3c69-4185-a960-72d8e2cc963d Conclusion:=247bd934-9a0b-4366-842a-0fdc663049af The touchscreen issue was resolved through a system reboot and register reload.
