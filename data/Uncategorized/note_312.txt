The Card readers were offline because of the mixing of DCR and HIghline dispensers. Once I isolated the Highline/salesmaker style dispenser The others came up and worked. The site is using a RUBYCI which only allows for 1 fuel channel and although it should work with the curret unique configuration I believe something is wrong with the kerosene dispenser. I am unable to access programming on the highline and the door containing the keypad was open meaning its been getting directly affected by weather conditions such as rain. I took pictures of the components and serial in case the customer would like us to attempt repairs. I am closing this ticket as complete for now and requested they call in these repairs when they are ready. Currently the kerosene has been decomissioned due to algae in the tank that has been treated to some degree. All test satisfactory.=87e915ce-9693-4378-99e9-fc5af376fab9 =8073849b-75e2-406f-a827-b4fb92095aeb 12.5-13 21 miles =1a3fa5b9-e070-4047-9755-cd4aad07cb28 13-15.25=1cc1386f-7636-4166-98ee-a100a55e19df 15.25-16.75 94 miles=4d9e2674-3ee0-405f-932e-154de902950d 230505-0181=2a35d7c1-ea78-4428-aeb5-fadc5b5b682a Stouts In & Out=ccdaadc8-ffd1-4edf-8d43-15629c4c242c 3525 A L Philpott highway=529d937d-9f7d-44d9-9797-8af572596c28 Axton, VA=afc825e9-25fd-429a-96db-feacde3dc6a6 =0e4d45cf-52aa-4c57-8c82-3e39bfe76670 Upon arriving at the site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). I encountered Will Hardy from Hardy Oil, who was on site to conduct an Exxon Mobil EMR+ loyalty/mobile payment upgrade, following the guidelines sent to him via email. Although the Central Interface (CI) had recovered by the time I arrived, the system was still operating at a significantly slow pace.=fcb62248-0b74-45a5-9650-323305a1abf2 =99dece51-4662-45f3-a9fb-e1df6f1d17d4 I reached out to Verifone for assistance and subsequently downloaded the relevant manual from the Premier Portal. Upon reviewing the first page of the manual, I discovered that the minimum software requirement for the upgrade was Buypass version 3.12.40. Notably, the site was utilizing version 3.12.30, and this crucial information was found on the second page of the provided guide, which I initially overlooked it also contained a typo stating that the minimum was 3.10.40.=9470fbe7-6801-4bf3-8eb2-5efaae507b3f =6bf3ad91-afc6-4f8b-a1c2-995a03f8f3cc I promptly informed Will and Raj, the Site Manager, about the discrepancy and initiated an automatic upgrade to version 3.12.40 (the latest available). I also explained that this upgrade would require 2-4 hours for completion. Raj decided it would be most suitable to execute the upgrade after the site's closing hours that night. Consequently, I supplied him with comprehensive instructions for the process.=3e65aca7-2915-45eb-80d3-b801cea206af =da1050b5-43bc-46f0-a638-d639dc96122f In addition, I deactivated the non-operational SiteConnector, which had been causing the system to slow down due to version incompatibility. The automatic upgrade did not appear on the CI until I allowed some time to pass and restarted the CI once more. Afterward, the upgrade was visible, and Raj was prepared to proceed with the instructions on Sunday night.=b37cf3af-3304-4af9-bf22-f284909dd4a3 =4b4959ce-04c5-4c10-a1ad-87c0ca946741 =d416cbb6-2632-4586-8ceb-dc2ac136bf74 58foodcorner1
