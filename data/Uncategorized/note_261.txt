Both the regular and premium grades were pumping slow. I installed new filters which drastically increased flow rate to roughly 9GPM.

FP3 the manager stated was continuing to run when nozzle was stopped. This was caused by a leak in the hanging hardware allowing air into the system. I corrected the issue by replacing the hose. I dispensed amd tested for leaks.

I deleted the fuel files on the EDH. Problem persisted. I cold started the dispenser and reprogrammed 5/6. After the problem still persisted. I contacted GVR TAC and was directed to perform a new hard drive procedure. After this too did not work I am left with clean imaging the EDH as the only iable option. I will need to obtain the image files and return for version 12.02.23.01 EPS TBI.
