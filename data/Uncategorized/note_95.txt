Nick allowed me access to the generator room. I started by removing the box cover from the top of the tank. However, this action accidentally triggered some of the front panel switches, making it difficult to establish their initial settings.=be766c64-8887-4b39-9c51-5aaec1c88137 =6461d1f3-2b12-4db3-a8e7-fcc31246203d It appeared that the switches were set to 'run' instead of 'auto.' This setting might have triggered a 'continuous run' alarm, tripping the Smart Controller Interface (STP-SCI) and consequently shutting down the product.=12ca1fdd-ba7f-4892-b4c9-43f2564f876a =1a346e3c-fb5e-4126-ad18-4644bf371b53 To correct the situation, I switched the generator to the 'off' position and reset the Controller. Afterward, I switched it to 'auto,' which initiated the generator to operate and refill the tank. To ensure the problem was resolved, I patiently waited until the 'low fuel' indicator light cleared, since direct observation of the tank level was not possible.=64117730-8e0b-4672-959c-4b2dff5ac820 =83a90f76-b365-454f-9c63-8d74cdbffae0 The generator appears to be functioning correctly now.

On inspection, I discovered a short in the wiring on the power wire for dispenser 1&2. I isolated this dispenser in the trough and brought dispenser 3&4 online. However, even though the card readers loaded successfully, the dispenser failed to establish communication.=046f49b7-44d5-4319-ab69-d4e062c9dba7 =5e14b41b-7d28-4f67-867b-70a2a7d5a342 Even after rebooting all equipment, I was still unable to bring the dispensers online. However, the Non-Ethenol dispenser was functioning correctly, indicating that the CI port was in good condition. Despite our troubleshooting attempts, we were unable to establish a closed loop on the FCI boards for positions 1-4.=3f7c6598-d5cf-41bf-95d4-618a6ee8c0c6 =948c206f-111f-4ded-b870-85d3402118b1 The site's electrician arrived and replaced the breaker. He switched it on and off then left, but we were unable to restore power through the breakers after he left. We had to wait for our electrician to restore power to the dispensers so that we could troubleshoot the 2W loop.=c1586966-cf1b-4ce7-97d5-fdf8d574af6b =7c179683-f986-4d60-9066-6913abf3e295 Upon arrival of our electrician, we found that the spares to 1/2 were unusable and pulling new wire would require the removal of the dispenser from the island. In the midst of the repair work, the Diesel dispensers went down, necessitating the replacement of the D-box board to restore communication. The Diesel dispensers shared boards in the BRCM with the gas dispensers.=788afb3c-3e07-4acc-bd72-f1cc9bcb19a1 =f7b67ced-2c20-43f9-a0c8-a877668bceaa To resolve these issues, a follow-up visit next week has been planned when we can get our project team to remove the dispenser.=dd041b5c-6e33-4255-ac63-4d5754447edc =e0d6fa89-6c11-40a8-a8d6-50e93c1c4568 =c07d6a6a-1cd2-4685-9692-9dd30ea81a70 =4e772d7e-1db4-4e6e-ba1c-70bd4161b387 =286f0bbc-2a61-4a6e-8994-2a8d5590300c
