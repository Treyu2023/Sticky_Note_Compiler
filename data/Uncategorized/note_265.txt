I checked out dispenser 11/12 and upgraded the OMNIA software to the latest version. I then contacted RTSS (unusually long wait time) to verify the serial connection of the dispenser. They were able to now see it.

FP's 1,5 and 7 were displaying "Leave Card Insterted" on the CRINDs. I purged the CRINDs on these three positions, when they came back up I ran a test and it stuck at the same message. I had the DEX rebooted and this brouhgt all 3 positions back online. I worked with the Manager to clear paper jams in a couple of dispenser printers.

FP 6 was not displaying the correct prompts for EMV. I checked the UPM settings & printed out a system health report for both sides. I noticed one of the Keys was missing from FP6 printout. I contacted GVR and had them download TLS certificates to the dispenser. I then used app to re-RKL the UPM. I then rebooted teh EDH and purged the CRIND on FP6. I cvhecked the passprot settings and then I cntacted GVR dispenser TAC and was told that this issue is likely a bad UPM. I will return to innstall a new UPM in dispenser. =a7205fa8-950c-4df3-9f9b-5575157b3c14
