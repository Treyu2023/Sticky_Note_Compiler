If the Premium has not been used for an extended period following a power outage, the line and hose pressure for Premium might be low.=e0753c7d-b1ce-4ceb-91b7-606026586c29 Cause of Error: When a regular transaction occurs first on these blend dispensers, it can inadvertently pressurize the Premium line through the relief ports in the check valves. This slight backward rotation of the pulsers, mistaken for the forward direction, leads to errors when attempting to dispense Mid Grade or Premium, as the system erroneously registers the pulser as spinning backwards.=9054d014-2966-4bca-ac15-a9d298d8f686 Resolution Approach:=7bb4d92a-bb10-4109-887b-971f84b41629 =fa153909-f150-4735-b9ac-8d7de350155e Immediate Solution: To rectify this, it's advisable to maintain constant pressure in the Premium line. If that's not feasible, the following steps can clear the error:=57e3f68b-ae18-4156-8f27-c0f0ab6b2b8a Power cycle the dispenser.=47e57bd9-35ab-467b-90c6-3e0881bbb471 Activate the Mid Grade product to pressurize the hose adequately.=fb37c6d9-f5da-49eb-bad0-765eb6ace1fd Hang up the nozzle. This should realign the pulser's direction and prevent the error from recurring until the next power loss event.=91167acb-0170-4c99-868b-43c3a7966ae7 Testing and Conclusion:=b04cb048-6547-4687-a5d9-001baf9748bf =f6bd4029-4442-4210-bae0-68e0b552fc0f After implementing the above solution, I conducted thorough tests on both dispensers. The tests confirmed that the error was successfully cleared and both dispensers were fully functional.=5352be79-399a-4353-8f6c-5e91fa06eedf Outcome:=fbd6499d-44b2-4aaf-8377-0674696a92ca The visit effectively resolved the 5047 error codes on dispensers 9 and 11 by addressing the underlying cause related to pulser direction post-power outage. Provided guidelines will assist in preventing future occurrences of this issue. All systems tested post-resolution indicated optimal performance.=5dd930d5-d12d-413b-9ce5-a6eacae89a4d =2ff15a69-102c-4dcc-866f-ab40138f72b6 =0fbf9d95-0aab-40ee-840e-976f4553378a
