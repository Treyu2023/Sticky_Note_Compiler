I rebooted all of the equipment. I spoke with our admin team and found that the Topaz was alredy reloaded. A replacement was brought from Raleigh. We could not obtain the software the site was running due to EOL software 3.12.25 Buypass. So instead I was forced to use software version 3.12.30, before replacing the Topaz I performed an Auto upgrade on the whole system. After upgrade completed it seems to have corrected the issue with the touch screen on the Topaz so replacement was not necessary. Everything came back up and worked except for the CRINDs which are still on a serial connection at the site. I changed the port to COM2 to utilize the LED's on the CI. I swapped the D-box board and the adapters & cable to confirm no issues with hardware. I could not contact Verifone due to site not having ASM agreement. After troubleshooting I am convinced that this software (3.12.30 buypass) no longer supports Serial CRIND communications. I reached out to admin team and need to reschedule a trip to convert the site to COIP. =6e166cc6-fdad-44b5-84a3-2a7d8c021d49 =4c46d115-da93-48a7-a55f-4d3184252b14 =666680a1-4579-4994-aca2-0ccb6f38edc4 =125bf142-6fbf-4fbe-acff-459949c32435 =80451655-63df-4e51-a8ae-63f2d13e8c11 =8988e3ae-5fd2-4b50-8453-ecf4c33f01a0
