I tested the ICR connection from the BRCM with no issue on 3 ICR's. I purged the ICR for FP 15 and it loaded as normal but returned to pump offline state. I contacted RTSS and they had me go ahead and replace the BRCM components. After this netted no change I then contacted NCR adn worked with them including sending piuctures of the LED conditions in the tiger box. I explained that the D-box portion of the BRCM both old boards and new boards are acting like the cables going to the tiger are not connected at all. This is appearant due to the LED lights on the D-box boards. NCR went on to troubleshoot files on their end in the meantime they cut me loose from the site. All pumps down NCR Issue.=afbf566b-85db-4bc0-8988-427819b70254 =b58196f9-6601-4014-a84a-829885f360d4 =2638699a-d80a-4c68-9eac-9aa7cfc78b67 =6cf51a0a-a501-42b1-b87c-c220e4924b2f
