FP3 & 9 already had parts ordered for tampering. The site has collected multiple receipts for low amount indicating further tampering. I checked all positions for tampering. FP's 9,10,5 and 6 had both shear valves closed. FP 3/4 had the premium shear valve closed (this could have caused issues with customers having small amounts when premium or mid grade were selected on FP4. FP 11/12 have an extra set of pulsera not being used. I used parts from them to fix FP3 and 9. No other tampering was detected. This only means if it occured that their tracks were covered. All FP's are operational at this time. All test ok.=localId_280a4df3a5254cd5bbf0d6c8e2cb8e77 =localId_87a123222735429491aee40076976f1f 12-13.5 Shop picked up parts for call.=localId_a4769c4a47f042098e610eb1a99ef3a0 =localId_772d832a935c4557b02d15b739216204 13.5-15=localId_6e804f1052a04ad3ba816f156beba091 15-16.25=localId_b0b66cb18a834d889e72b238e1ba373a 16.25-19.5rttdh=localId_fe3d64730c374f5ba7f9e7a919668137 135958=localId_1bc9e75b054941dda45ea77c8ab1e48b 64250639=localId_49ed02f7e05048eda32701407807f969 EZ Mart 4246=localId_5566dc27cd8b40ee959ccb30845848f1 3085 Clarksville St=localId_6cebf85540404587b1e7bd5d2432bdd2 Paris=localId_50c8785709394727a1f12e352a248e5e =localId_999955229aec4994a6363fc8678e366e Arrived on-site, checked in on Verisae and with MOD. I tested the customer display by swapping ports before replacing. I found that the cable was nicked in two places causing a short to the shielding. This being a powered port (1 cable going to device) it damaged port 3 as well as 2 when I tried that port. I then Replaced with new unit and set it up on port 5. All test ok.
