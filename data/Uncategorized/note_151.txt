Checked ATG programming and found the Auto Event for the Overfill Output relay was configured for T:1 and T:2 alarm condition but not T:3 (Premium) I corrected this to power the relay when any of the three tanks overfill condition is met. I tested the alarm via the test button and from the ATG test relay feature. I then pulled the probe to the Regular tank T:1 and slowly moved the float to simulate overfill condition, when I did this the alarm sounded as intended. The Premium grade previously was not going into alarm due to programming on the ATG. Corrected and tested alarm.

FP 17 EN357988. I was able to fuel on this position just fine, This position wasn't bagged off either. The volume of the beeper was set to low. I moved the jumper to turn up the volume for the beeper on the PIP3. I tested the dispenser. All test ok. The site asked about FP 13 which has had a drive off and the hardware is now cartailed. the manager stated that they do not have a hose and/or nozzle to replace. So I replaced with hardware from my truck. Tested for leaks.

He stated that FP 1,5 and 13 all have the same issue with customer card complaints. I tested FP 13 with Debit transaction and it worked , but I got loyalty unavailable when it asked for loyalty. I then tried to initiate loyalty before payment and in this transaction the CRIND just hung on please wait. I warm started the dispenser and connected to it with laptop to see if any configuration was off. nothing I could spot so I reloaded the software for the OMNIA and both UPMs before I tested loyalty succesfully. after upgrade it did perform secure device updates. The manager asked that I check dispenser 5 CR 05 error. The TS guide showed that this is an issue where the dismount sensors are at fault. I removed the CR and checked the track of the bezel to ensure nothing was impeding the operation of the sensors. I then re-installed the CR and re-routed the ground and coms cables. Then I activated and tested the card reader.

I noticed PAP started at the top of the screen under welcome which was odd. I reloaded the OMNIA and this cleared that message but I was still unable to process a loyalty transaction on this dispenser aswell so I reloaded both UPM's and then re-tested EMV Debit with loyalty.

I removed water from al three Spill buckets primary containment (1-5 gallons each) and took pictures of before and after for attaching to ticket. I cleaned the Grooves the lid sits in of debris which would cause them to take on water. The REGUL plow ring is cracked allowing water in. I repaired the missing rubber seal on the Premium which had fallen into the water in the spill bucket. All test ok.
