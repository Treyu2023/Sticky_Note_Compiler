It was noted that the hose had been returned to the site prior to my arrival. I proceeded to reconnect the breakaway mechanism and conducted comprehensive fueling tests. All test results were satisfactory and within expected parameters. Turns out there were two dispensers and the hose was still missing from dispenser 3. I replaced the missing hose swivel nozzle and breakaway. Tested fueling. All test ok.=51a41ff4-0ecb-4ab3-aee1-499bbeadf93c =2c5d37b7-c461-4f86-a49c-940911e51240 10.5-11 33 miles=80a5e23d-454a-47e9-b38b-bed26df91721 11-11.5=1ffe1343-8589-4574-ba7d-de622b72363d 230501-0378=83b4d162-d334-4772-9e8e-0f022fee9686 FWKD5579045=6c9de5ea-f6fd-4687-b8d0-fecc82d64471 711 41957=2c6df3d5-35b1-42f3-83f9-fa5b2dd660d3 800E Cornwallis Dr=008dbe30-e57d-4d6e-9d3b-983827bd9c89 2108 N Church St=e374c748-4f64-4a94-a2ef-2a242ec38070 =ce497fca-5801-4ea5-ade0-28047b4ac8e5 =86f3547c-edb7-4e00-a82c-1057bdc61de6 Upon arrival at the site, I promptly checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD). I observed that the breakaway mechanism was severed on Fuel Pump #4. I took the necessary steps to reconnect the breakaway. The manager informed me that the issue regarding the missing dispensers on the Point of Sale (POS) system was attributed to a system error. This error was rectified by the corporate team through a system reboot. Subsequently, I re-enabled Dispenser 1 from the register and conducted a thorough test to ensure proper functionality of FP 1&4. All test satisfactory.=38775ad7-9101-4126-ac04-6c1e5797fe9b =d65d55c0-7fc8-4471-b4b5-bd7d4d3cc3f0 11.5-14.25  20+36+ 40=78c53986-41d8-4acf-9cee-4718fcda720a 14.25-16.5=961cad1b-7b8c-45b8-a946-91d51fc0cc7a 16.5-17.75 65 miles=d20213ff-8e86-4cea-818f-f79a3323e898 230503-0179=503a8714-fc0b-4bf3-80cd-37fc75474077 Two Brothers #2=559aeeea-160d-42fd-8bfd-351c55a10522 5000 University PKWY=27f9960c-58a1-4eee-b981-dfa82a86cec9 Winston-Salem=28754996-3133-4a80-8f1b-64fa86b1fed2 =57ace605-a4d5-46a8-bcae-4b9a7c2a9810 MANAGER=0d3a7b0e-0c7e-4b18-9a7c-83faf04863e7 MOU12349=213dac8b-86bd-470c-8534-ae5d7cfe5863 VSID 4184802=6211b68b-efb9-4527-9487-57a2819421dd =e74b531c-dbe6-485a-a1cc-80c903dfcf35 I was first directed to the shop, followed by a visit to the REO office in Reidsville, before ultimately arriving at the site in Winston Salem. Upon arrival, I checked in with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and began the process of replacing the RUBY2 system. After successfully setting up the register, the PIN Pad encountered a "blue screen" issue.=5bd93645-138c-47ad-8dc1-9d249e755fb5 =1f9cb43a-cb3c-476b-aaac-828896ed72fc I promptly reached out to Verifone for assistance and obtained a case number for a potential replacement. To my delight, they informed me that a solution to this issue was available. Verifone provided me with a file to be sent to the PIN Pad via the netloader function. After completing the process, I proceeded to initialize the EMV and tested the PIN Pad. The device passed all tests and was confirmed to be functioning properly.=ca5564a4-f52b-44f2-b369-f1b3e7fe8754 =3cc9a828-0052-473a-b762-4eef89d481da The RUBY 2 was provided by REO no part added to ticket=bd5c5837-c03f-411d-be98-18eac2ee3119 216-226-057 out (CI)=ad190f80-bc9d-4733-bd4b-a4c3fd10e375 216-511-929 IN=f45fc7d9-ce0c-48b6-a81d-6d7c05359b5c =ff8c7568-9303-49ca-9876-f39b5fc6bbb6 case# 08832035    for POP replacement
