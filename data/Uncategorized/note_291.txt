I put FP 5/6 in standalone and could not replicate thei ssue. I checked both premium and regular check valves while no one else was dispensing any products. neither were leaking. I pulled pump logs and found many 5047 (reverse flow detected) error codes from yesterday (the time was incorrectly reporting april 21st of 2000. The 5047 error codes were dealt with by power cycling the dispenser. I corrected the time and updated the door node and PCN software. Mike asked that I replace the card reader on FP 5 because it was hard to insert a card. I did so and activated both sides card readers after. Then on rebooting the UPM for FP 5 would no longer display any video. I replaced the UPM and performed RKL and TLS certificate download. I then could not get 5 or 6 online, turns out all of the dispensers here are configured for OMNIA_Custom. Despite the fact that there are not OMNIA boards installed. This is the first site I have came accross that uses this option. I could not find any information on this setting, but every time I activated it I would have to reactivate the card readers, but I was unable to assign them an IP in this configuration or change the IP of either UPM also the VLAN jumpers are not on the CCP boards. I contacted TAC to figure out What this Custom setting does, while waiting for GVR TAC I swapped it back to standard again and found that the 50 error codes had cleared. I IP'd and activated both card readers for the 5th time and they came up and worked. Tac never answered the phone. I tested EMV debit on FP 5 and printed a receipt to show the cashier. All test ok.=fb9d783a-5dd3-405e-9184-84a8b5c192bb =43ce5577-b85a-4ed2-8ba6-fcb43b803b16 =e748fbc4-616f-4a6c-b840-8bf46c768252 =65dc4753-ac6e-4060-aa14-184f1ca8b32f =b80b0c94-6945-4d76-85d8-4492be573a36 liquifierM04388A001
