I Installed the Pump controller board in FP 3/4 and programmed it. This allowed for the dispenser to operate, unfortunately the CRINDs were still down The parts they sent with me could not get the CRINDs up. I waited while Lee ran parts to me at the site. Once He arrived we got all the CRINDs up and fpund that the Ribbon cable on FP 3 was broken. I believe this is what caused most of the issue, we replaced the monochrome CPU the CRIND logic on FP3.
