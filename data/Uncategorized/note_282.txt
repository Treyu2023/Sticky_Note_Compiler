FP#2 CRIND would hang on please leave card inserted requiring reboot to restore crind screen. I ran a test card transaction. I reloaded software for both 1 and 2 FCBs. I updated the resources and Debians as well. Afterwards I was able to use a card at the CRIND. FP 2 was still offline with the register and DEX. I had to reboot the DEX twice. FP2 came up as intended but FP3 went down until the second reboot.

Site has new Encore dispensers and a new price sign and controller module (Control Gate by PWM). The module did not auto update the prices one time and the manager editted the price manually. He also inadvertently locked the screen in the process. I contacted PWM and got the code to unlock the screen and gave it to the manager. FP2 worked when tested. I trained the manager on troubleshooting printer issues on dispensers.

The Gross line fail for Premium at 2:45 PM today had to be acknowledged and cleared before a re-test could be performed. Om retesting it was discovered that the earlier event was a fluke. The manager stated something about not having any premium earlier. After enabling the line I monitored dispensing for a bit.
