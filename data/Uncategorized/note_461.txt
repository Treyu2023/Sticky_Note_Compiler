FP6 head 5150  Arrow codes and all PP windows. I power cycle the dispenser and test it each grade. The soft keypad right side had a crease rendering in op. I replaced the right keypad and overlay. The hose was leaking at the swivel (could be cause of error code). I asked site for parts before replacing with truck stock.

After speaking with the manager & DEX. I found that the site can not print receipts inside for sales that originated at the dispenser CRINDs. This is due to a known outtage, dex is currently working on it with no ETA for fix at this time.

The crinds were down earlier, this appears to be in relation to the outage dex is experiencing. The crinds are backup and working now. The only issue at this time is that they can't print outside receipts from register. Register. Dex is aware of this and actively working on a fixed. All printers tested outside.
