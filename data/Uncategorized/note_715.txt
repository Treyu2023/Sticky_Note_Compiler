He explained that dispenser 5/6 (EN263848) was not working  on either side of the dispenser. I was told the hanging hardware was replaced and new. I found that the 3/4" breakaway  on FP 5 was bad and causing a no flow issue. The keys were messing up on 6 because of bent pins on the door node. Once ew straightened them out and ran a few tests everything is now dispensing. The Door Node on FP 6 remains an issue anda we had to leave that posiotion offline due to that. FP 9/10 is needing a PCN and possibly door nodes due to corruption=606b5259-86b3-463d-99ce-aac5aa4bc377 =1a5fb31f-d123-4e7c-9907-7f3ab7e5e40c 240614-0106=6f0f0f4e-2be9-4acc-8c77-e6ca2bc46212 =1d3c0a87-d4fd-4fce-9b63-f5a82e154700 14.75-15.25=44a702b6-4f45-4587-af14-b12ff08853d6 15.25-16.5=1aab5676-0c41-4b08-b4be-de459280ba07 16.5-17.5 50 miles=646635e0-eaae-4694-9647-1e9ad2bf9b72 240611-0177=497fede1-ee24-444b-b459-3dbb3f010a7c CK 2723476=7e58d850-b153-49fa-9fac-91a654393e4c 3302 S Holden Rd =0e7efc8a-1051-4917-9f3f-67e5e1c7197e Geensboro NC 27407=df763d36-80de-4b0d-ba1d-cdc7d44eaecb =0325725e-5f81-4193-819c-0c9e8373d873 Actions Taken=0b0ba9a8-b908-447a-be4d-33fda23d57f2 Arrived on-site per the email with Laiza and checked dispensers 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12.=a66c035c-7de5-4952-b21d-f743717a68e8 Verified that dispensers 7/8 and 9/10 had the correct software.=14083b59-f091-4e03-b040-5f52c67dd0da Found that dispensers 11/12 did not have the correct software and updated it accordingly.=fb3878aa-0056-44d4-aa9c-fa1ba7576357 Unregistered and re-registered dispensers 7/8 and 9/10.=250d5f94-af19-4fc9-994e-95d610367187 Encountered an issue during re-registration for 9/10 and contacted TAC, speaking with Blake.=11069656-031b-4975-a5c1-ba0217ed2471 Blake indicated potential issues on his end, affecting multiple sites and locking him out from assisting further.=b5125cde-f9a9-4b07-a5a1-de20a3ef8e4b Noted that re-registration might be possible later, but it could not be completed at this time.=eeac445a-d069-491a-9933-76ceb92e1a38 Conclusion=24f6b3d0-88ae-48f1-b9fe-0b4abbe120f8 Dispenser 11/12 software was updated successfully. Despite the inability to re-register 9/10 due to issues potentially on TAC's end (server side), this does not affect the operational capacity of the fueling positions. All tests confirmed proper functionality of the dispensers, and there are no disruptions in gas delivery. All tests are okay.=397a5957-9f30-490c-bbd1-6e5c951d7881 =bb0fa2fc-802d-4c6a-9db4-cd84727363eb =3475c2a1-d40a-4e80-ab7c-b9118bb6a6a9 =78383d6f-e998-4d44-b69a-b7ef0b0cfd68 =1d28adff-a212-46f8-8358-ef05e80dd2d6 =f10097dd-f90f-4d78-8d7e-802327cf3237 =dd7d4859-b813-4d13-8b49-90fa73cbc1f0
