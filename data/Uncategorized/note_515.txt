Returned to site to reload the CI and replace if necessary. Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I reloaded the CI and programmed most of it by hand. The site had issues with internet connectivity, but the customer resolved this issue consolidating his modems in the process. Afterwards the internet was much more stable. I had to rebuild the customers screens but was able to push the departments and PLUs from the backup. After copying the network settings from the pictures prior to reloading the network had the wrong terminal ID configured which caused some issues with the card table download but we were able to get this ironed out. fuel debit credit are all working now. I configured the reports with the customer and trained him on some of the POS features. The Applause is not working at this time and I dont have a USB disk made to reload the server ready at this time. The applause is the only thing not working at this time. All test ok.=47d7a2db-bf6c-4972-9b61-6ba0e7e9db0e =25bf47a1-1a3e-4a92-9af8-fd6dfc6959e0 =79b60ace-dd45-4435-9c09-cf5d6a3fc9a2 =025beb95-bf8a-4e91-b973-9bf44a21e43c =8157f9e2-edbe-4426-a163-7121130afb7a 864M740=812a3545-2249-4154-aa8b-ce7298b29dc4
