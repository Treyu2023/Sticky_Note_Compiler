I'm pleased to report that the server issues have been resolved, and as a result, dispenser 1/2 is now successfully online with Insite360. The registration process proceeded without any complications, confirming that the previous issues were indeed related to the server downtime. Dispenser 1/2 is now fully operational and integrated with the network. I also contacted GUardian Connect to ensure everything looked good from their end.

Specifically, the system did not prompt for secure EMV transactions, adding extra steps to the installation process.=3c89fca5-7440-450f-9f18-0bc00e563dc5 Troubleshooting EMV: Despite several attempts, including EMV initialization, purging, and rebooting the dispenser, the issue persisted. The resolution was only achieved after a comprehensive reboot of the Commander system, logging out and back in, and reloading the card reader directly from the register.=2dc75cf9-7af1-4aa2-b7f5-9a5c546c0b79 Observations and Resolution:=16139dc2-9738-49cf-93e7-0988622ed84a =1709fa2d-94a6-4601-8754-f4e43768b766 The EMV Kernel portion of the CRIND's load appeared to be the critical factor, as it was the only notable difference post-reboot that enabled proper functioning. After this adjustment, the EMV functionality was restored, and the dispenser began operating as expected.=19e19ca3-2ae3-4875-b378-328c84c8a38d Serial Numbers and Part Details:=3077a104-8be3-4e84-aa02-cbefd5906a15 =934984f3-281d-408b-ae5e-73fd9a439280 New UPM Serial: IN - 03131495=fd3ae885-6abf-4915-9256-898db3c2d623 Replaced UPM Serial: OUT - 02922236=72ee1fd4-1545-4a76-91be-a7ee77c121a3 Conclusion:=896a2329-376c-4cea-983b-a0a644457428 The replacement of the UPM and subsequent detailed system reboots and reloads were necessary to resolve the EMV enabling issue at FP 7. This solution highlights the intricate dependencies within the systemâ€™s software, particularly in relation to new features like contactless EMV. Moving forward, these steps can serve as a reference for similar issues across other dispensers.
