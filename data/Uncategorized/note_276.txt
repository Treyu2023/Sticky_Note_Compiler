Arrived on-site, FP #4 was displaying "Please Pay Inside". I purged the CRIND and it came back to CRIND BIOS screen. When Thomas arrived I gained access to the Commander and rebooted it. This brought the dispenser back online. I ran the BRCM tool which updated all of the SSoM's and I upgraded all 6 of the UPM's from the BRCM following migration path (42.11.22>42.11.47>42.11.50) keeping them on the EMV Kernel 3.09 but updating to the latest variant. I tested Card transaction on FP 4.

Roe and I worked out that both of the D-box boards were unsalvagable. We used one he had and one from my truck. Once we got the Gasboy OPRT talking to the dispensers we found that communications could not be established on FP 2,3 and 4.  Fueling Positions 1, 5/6 & 7/8 were all working. FP 4 had a water spigot beside it on the island and it was leaking. a crew was here trying to find the leak and they have the concrete saw cut and dug down to it. They have been pumping water from the ground constantly while we were here. We suspect the three positions not working are inundated with water that has breached the conduits and shorted the wiring. We isolated these channels in the D-Box to not  damage the replacement boards. Additionally we shut off the breakers to these three positions while repairs are being made to the water pipe.
