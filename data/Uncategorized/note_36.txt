Installed the ECPU2 upgrade kit in the tank monitor and reprogrammed off the previous printout. This correcte5rd the issues with the printer, but the probe out would not clear. I checked the probe type and found that the Premium is using MAG Plus probe. I tried swapping the probe module to another channel. I contacted parts and had them pull a probe module for me to pick up and return to the site. Once I returned I had 2 probe modules old and new style. I installed each of them and neither worked. I read the resistance on the probes at the tank monitor and went to the probe and read it there to rule the probes and wiring out. I then disassembled the tank monitor again to see if I could see anything I missed the first time and found that the AC input module varisitor is blown on the back side of the panel. I shared this information with my service manager. This means that one or more of the components that have been replaced could be damaged by this varisitor. Additionally the back wall of the tank monitor is bulged inward and possibly touching the back side of the backplane board. ordering a new a/c input module and everything already replaced so that we will have anything that could be damaged when we return.=1f78129b-5a55-4450-a4cd-f66fe5683764 =9de68807-d9b4-4629-92cf-ce5df921ff4da/c input - 329443-001=b11a0b23-b58b-41f6-9ce8-a6cba8b72d6aprobe mod - VRT329356-002=bb5089f4-08f4-40e2-803f-df4916873addecpu2 - VRT331500-308=72681cbd-521e-44c5-bd97-8b9a042b8151barrier - VRT331898-001=04102fad-28a7-421a-b939-4d7dca0338b2PSU - VRT330734-001=22267cfb-222e-4392-b996-488512fbe0ffInterconnect board - VRT329263-001=f6e95e43-7a5d-4d0b-94fc-4f95e7c309b7backplane board - 329257-001=6d31fff5-49b7-429e-b285-6be961981b10=ef16f9e3-9282-4363-8117-287efd1595b4 =localId_deec4505aa0f47da98b421b7212e1ae0 =localId_90ded109fc6a4ddb9ed2266f1c25859a =localId_bfddf2a87611421d9e53310b6e195d34 =localId_b05ed047e3dc4d09ba4aae1e971a8677 =localId_b6cdb92eac7a4830b100c62dbba98922 =localId_89abbcead8c14df5972412ee42895fac =localId_2e5597bbf1e644a2b50ee86684bfdc74 =localId_b8d30e740c0d4b08b1a06eb19d903a6d
