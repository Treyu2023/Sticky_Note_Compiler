The Plenti rewards issue was acknowledged, and the site was advised to open a ticket for further investigation. All work was completed, but the cloud connect activation could not be finalized.=24eaf1cc-1179-42e3-bd8b-70f74637dcd5 BCB852064894=ec02aa97-8f89-42f0-9aaa-c62e6d0b5d15 =41083bf6-178c-4ab5-bd33-43431185851b site ID - Exxon 47467=81cdcc01-a70a-44eb-a63c-defe1ce5efb7 =dedf2c84-2509-48e8-bf31-cfa828409bfc =45ad704e-5c0b-4334-86c0-2704d8c5a423 12.45-1.15=8ee2f6ef-096c-48ac-8039-889ea170c86b 1-3.15 =86459d21-9417-47f6-bab3-46bacc1c9b21 =756bd5c1-8619-446d-a378-456370f884e1 240811-0024=9bd29eff-1362-44f1-bd08-eae5726f9101 PO - 285993794=85e58642-8374-493c-b602-0a5b02348608 Refuel 1170 Great Stops 7=47de3fb6-8c38-4117-81d3-7d442888522a 2410 E Market St=529ae0ad-56b7-4953-ba8d-40f2c964ab7f Greensboro NC 27401=c47119a3-7f05-4eba-9468-f15b6f18c126 =b68a4e06-c41e-44e2-8d78-22119af3c850 On-Site Report:=8575af01-1f72-4c20-95a0-d8cc914c859f =f120a2f5-4854-4a49-9bfe-d1a610300eb2 Upon arrival, I observed that two dispensers were already unbagged, but positions 3, 4, 11, and 12 were bagged. I successfully brought most of the positions online by purging and/or rebooting them before proceeding to discuss the situation with the manager.=25ea6457-32a4-43ec-b58e-db87293ec35a =16b50313-0509-4501-b7f0-99b81f79f10f Dispenser 12 was stuck at the BIOS screen. I informed the manager that a UPM replacement might be necessary, and I would need to retrieve one from the office. After returning and receiving the keys to access the dispenser, I performed a power cycle on the UPM before replacing it. Surprisingly, the dispenser came back online after the power cycle, and no replacement was needed.=76f94a56-07a3-41f6-8848-6061ec03cfb5 =b38d823c-c56b-4a5a-b5a0-17144c58f078 All dispensers were restored to working order through either rebooting or purging the CRINDs.

First I tried to clear the sale on the register and rebooted the Commander. At this point the cashier had metioned the screen was blank on the CRIND for FP 4. I rebooted the dispenser and this cleared up the issue with the screen while also allowing me to clear the sales on the register for this position. FP 6 had a CR02 error I rebooted the CRIND and it worked when it came back up and worked flawlessly. All test ok.
