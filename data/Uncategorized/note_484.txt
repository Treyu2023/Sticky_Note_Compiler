I checked the programming, purged crind and reloaded software. Nothing made any difference until I rebooted the fuel controller. Once that was done FP12 became operational again.

I tried dispensing reg and got 6 cents before it stopped. The veeder root was showing over capacity for T3. The float was stuck in the riser likely due to overfilling the tank. T1 reg and T3 reg are manifolded. Overfilling the tanks may have caused an issue with siphoning. After correcting the issue with the float the Veeder Root was showing accurately that T3 is out of fuel. It's likely the siphon will work when conditions are corrected, but I can not diagnose the issue without a fuel delivery. All work complete at this time. =localId_4b2b7a4118d44665bd738c2a2a54d006 =localId_a4cb8785bb8249ea8c86e457d02feff2 14-15=localId_1040344ba10d434e9f66a92c5589189d 15-16=localId_2fd3848d578c4ddf8ab5e19368efebb8 16-17.25 End=localId_d8cfe00d49a44e5c96a1f049e08aa964 138474=localId_a6cea013f5ad41dd8c35e1c0ad6ac47d FWKD4337938=localId_bb80a25cf0e6412da5098b644e146190 2935 Camp Wisdom=localId_c3d58c641d734a65a18e93eee6fd7376 Dallas=localId_73f1ce277f1f433da75858e4588eb2c6 =localId_d524d8ff198b4f89a11b47ce060a8870 Arrived on-site, checked in on SN & with MOD. FP#5 &10 a customer stated were not working. FP5 is working at this time. FP10 the nozzle and swivel were damaged. I replaced them and tested for leaks.
