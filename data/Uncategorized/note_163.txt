Initially, the screens of FP 9 did not display any issue. However, after discussing with the manager, I was informed of an intermittent problem. The CRIND display occasionally shows "Busy" and "One moment please". The dispenser in question is an FPIV Encore 700, fitted with UX410's.=935eae47-6d92-42af-9d33-87d0acb24789 =18ea7ff2-dd76-4fce-bc33-30e1c807aabf To address this, I:=ed0a04fa-55c2-4e9e-88d0-8320ffef6329 =f938d6a2-3c57-470b-9205-6c87cdb9c424 Deactivated the UX410 feature, as sometimes it can mistakenly detect electrical noise as the initiation of a contactless transaction.=72c19d57-aeb2-4719-a3cb-e7c149445ab3 =da943788-cdef-4ec8-a821-686505808dfb Verified the programming settings of the CRIND relative to the pump, ensuring that there were no discrepancies between side A and B.=4267a6e2-8af6-4ea1-aada-98a47416ab2b =c6497103-f2f0-4cf2-af51-f9111c9b8b9c Updated the software on both sides of the dispenser for the CRINDs. Notably, there was a discrepancy in the EMV Kernel version: while the site was running on version 52.11.50 EMV 3.09 according to the M7 comparison tool, my software of the same version showed EMV 3.10. I downloaded the software from GVR once more and noted the same difference. When I got a printout from FP9 and another dispenser FP8 they showed 3.10 on the printout.  I proceeded to update the CRINDs with this software.=ab47af03-a2e6-48ef-934d-1dca1b457636 After these adjustments, I conducted a test with an EMV Debit transaction and reinstated FP 9. All systems were functioning correctly at the time of departure. =3f91fc64-7ee1-422c-8421-69f39abd1848 =cd0977be-95b0-4dd1-851d-6f9cf801290a =eac79fa6-9492-468e-91bc-dd8bec870ab0 11.25-11.5=fc8c29d1-2a00-4733-8b61-2110915e2129 11.5-12.25 (Mobile Tech Issues)=dd2f6bc3-0d7a-4c54-a017-47b1330ade7c Same Site=d3046567-43a8-40e3-89f2-e2dab5f49b79 230804-0294=8e763136-fb81-4e50-8345-34c70d40601e Circle K 2723011=c6abdc35-94eb-405f-9a6f-f01ae7201c76 2820 Lillington HWY=a74af5ae-49e6-4d56-bad3-37d40d5cd4f0 =eab46ede-4edc-4836-99b6-30c3ebbd7a85 On-site from a prior job, I addressed an issue with FP 13's nozzle, which had a sticking latch.

Found that the L18 sensor linked with the Diesel Fill containment (OPW 1C Series) may be the culprit. This containment is double-walled, and its secondary compartment houses the sensor. Upon accessing the sensor, it appeared to be free from liquid besides some condensation and wasn't signaling an alarm. Notably, the last alarm was recorded at 10:21PM on 8/21/23, indicating a sensor outage. I attempted a sensor flip test to gauge its functionality, but the Veeder root system didn't register the sensor's activity. Given that the sensor's design prevents direct inspection or replacement, it seems that a deeper dive is necessary, involving dismantling the spill bucket. This will enable a thorough inspection for potential wiring issues or even sensor replacement. This task is better suited for the projects team, warranting their involvement for either repair or replacement.=f4d6185d-c4e7-46f7-adaa-26bab65c588a =1f8a14f2-6fab-41f2-9c36-50a2023e8b64 14.5-14.75 5 miles=5475c10d-8977-4d63-b02d-e81cb4ad245d 14.75-16=59788409-3a37-4ef9-8b28-3524818e5ca2 DH 16-17.5 75 miles=25c35190-3a0d-40fc-89a5-665f917bb2d7 PO - FWKD2155735=3e303e53-c0b7-4dc4-8556-81ee2264dc15 230810-0065=62342cf3-c3e3-4544-83ed-2f7973662864 Circle K 2723050=75f8c547-45cd-4585-8dd9-2d604fae4baa 327 Chicken Foot Rd=db3c57a4-9d6a-49dc-84ae-a6423b62a084 Hope Mills NC, 28348=3fd59dcf-0a79-47e1-bfc1-7c34e148f964 =541d3e1c-e24d-4dc5-a6f6-c30306c47754 THE-6565 (liscense plate suspect of hit and run)=06df36ef-4b92-49bc-8237-63a716012b26 =937d791d-150c-478d-a7fe-90439b795793 8/22/23 RK - After arriving and checking in with the MOD, I took several actions. First, I replaced the 1" swivel on FP 14's Hi-Flo Diesel dispenser, ensuring there were no leaks. Next, I observed dispenser 5 but couldn't detect any leaks even when customers used it. Concerning FP 1 and 9, the site mentioned some anomalies with transaction time-outs. I ran a manual test to measure the time-out period, which took over 5 minutes, allowing me to rule out any concerns there. Notably, I observed the UX410's light flashing intermittently on FP 1. After verifying that the UX410 feature wasn't disabled, I proceeded to deactivate it, suspecting it might be interfering with the Card takeover feature. I implemented the same action for dispenser 9, as it reportedly had a similar issue. Informed the manager to keep a close watch on these dispensers to note if the problem recurs.=d98bd822-1587-4084-a109-acd4b7aa115f =bb58e7ca-b965-4dbd-ba4d-224bff041109 =b9d03296-ebf7-4a7d-999b-5cdeb40271fa
