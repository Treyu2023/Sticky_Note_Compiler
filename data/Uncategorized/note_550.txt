The PX60 Server had no power. I found that the plug underneath the base of unit had came loose. Correcting this restored power.

I rebooted the dispenser, server, EDH and wincor devices. The CRIND came online for FP7, but with the message "No Card Pay Now". I purged the CRIND. After download completed the CRIND was saying no poll and line break. I went over the configuration and found issues with the network configuration. I corrected the network configuration and purged both sides of dispenser. After all the changes I wound up having to reboot the EDH again before I could successfully test a card. All test ok. FP5 has parts ordered on another ticket.=localId_48690b603f2b4eb9b140562339559b84 =localId_ea18c39d74bf4dbf877dd7602150b957 =localId_c007c47593114ca58f732db9a435e78f 16-16.75=localId_b8a0045d72704847aef86f83f4078189 16.75-17.25=localId_5cf12444892d4f8d8636735e8732d3cd 17.25-18.5 rttdh=localId_6f722d19a4ce4ed0b338f69db6d70eee 137345=localId_67cec105ff39457ebd18351f8a746c75 205085889=localId_f93658352fae4c5abb4ad96fbbb63271 RT=localId_9334ec55da2948e18a44cacd0296e128 1840 East Chase PKWY=localId_3b739c74a9234793a273fe79dbafc1f0 Ft Worth=localId_e5bb66e8c621469f85b4ad4514beb2b2 =localId_63109d717fe9417ba9a156e365245665 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.
