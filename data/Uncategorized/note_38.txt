FP 19 and 20 I put in standalone & tested the Diesel.  Both sides dispense at a rate consistent with locked meter bleed through. This is confirmed by the fact that the pulsers are not turning. Sight has Eco meters with 4 diesel positions which are all affected to some degree. I pulled a sample from the diesel tank. I was only able to pull from the fill need a bailer to check the probe access. Incompleting call and inquiring if the site already has eco meters ordered.=localId_5de9ebb89645471dba7d396e249b6c7d =localId_1d70f358ddea4202af32eff85e7ce7d9 =localId_ddd72b61cdd942e98b85c28c381e64d8 SS12-12.5=localId_40446511dc0e4419ac0635c388719224 134397=localId_204089eff86a41adb76eec3e3e9e011d FWKD3508311=localId_5e44ac74e3a046f98669b9cf388cd18f =localId_a5a1685f70b24d0686c75f5c5e999154 Already on-site,  This issue is related to multiple other open tickets for this site. It appears several equal meters Have been replaced here in the last few months and are going back bad again due to contaminated debris in the product lines And thanks. These need to be treated before any more meters are replaced.

Ran tests on fp 13/14 to confirm operability. I tested all grades and they all dispensed and stopped on the mark. I pulled event logs and found that grade 6 [E85] for side B was showing over runs once in a while. I am ordering E85 proportional valve for this position. Will return to complete.

I'm not sure exactly what the ticket description means, but when I flip L:9 [1/2] L:10 [3/4] goes into alarm. When I flip L:10 [5/6] L:11 goes into alarm. Long story short this is someone's doing. I will need to return during normal hours 2 people required because sorting this out with 1 person would take an excessive amount of time. Incompleting call.
