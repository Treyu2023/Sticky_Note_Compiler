One of the servers HDD's failed and was unreadable. I replaced the HDD and ran the restore functions. This returned it to a normal state, site is running shell 10. 10 software and using a brother printer. While this software doesn't support this printer GVR was able to provide me with the workaround. This involved running new HDD from system recovery deleting and restoring approved launcher files and reinstalling the printer files. All test OK.=localId_72ebf19dc30d4bbca8bb310e1c3bc261 =localId_c4523474f10a41a1938e3f6204e98a47 =localId_7fe0fef624b5479f845f5e5f676b1a2b 13.5-14.75=localId_f1a38a7703334205b4ec009b581ffb42 14.75-18=localId_06f53847d7474e1f986ed51b9996b58f 133761=localId_d0e1dadd95344a119853bdff86072de8 FWKD3392775=localId_db1c49bce09341678662496b2f626b17 Arrived on-site,checked in on SN and with MOD. The regular STP relay was chattering only when I closed the door. I shut off power to STP and all dispensers to minimize danger. I quickly troubleshoot the issue to the power supply on dispenser number 2FP number 1 and 2 I kept the breaker off and disconnected it in the dispenser. There's another ticket open for number 3 I would like to make sure this ticket is completed prior to FCB replacement. I'm on it a feeling operations for a bit. I'll test OK.
