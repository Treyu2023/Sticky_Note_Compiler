Could not check in with Verisae because the ticket was closed by accident last trip. I installed the new GSoM for side b (FP12) but I could not get it to take an IP the entire time it kept giving error of two side A GSoMs were detected can not proceed.The new GSoM remained default IP of 172.16.100.6 I spoke to TAC and they suggested I disconnect the two wire going in to isolate any other GSoM's and after that we even programmed the SSoM with the externals being the site scheme and the internals matching the already configured side B and this produced the same error. At this point even TAC stated that it could be any num ber of the CRIND devices I am going to order the whole CCP assembly and replace it because this will be the third trip. All test ok. The other side is back up with the SSoM programmed will return with parts.
