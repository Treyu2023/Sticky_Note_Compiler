The Veeder root was showing 0 metered sales when I first printed a report for today on the Regular product metered sales were showing 0. I rebooted the ATG which shut down fuel. I rebooted the EDH and had issues with CRIND on 9. I power cycled the dispenser and eventually got all dispensers back online. The ethernet cable going to the ATG had a bad end on it and would not stay plugged in so I remade the connector. I was able to pull a fresh printout which now showed metered sales.

I checked voltages and amperage from the STP relay in the electrical room. After not finding any issue I put dispenser1&2 in standalone and tested Diesel. I found that all 4 diesel positions are exhibiting the same symptoms as FP 1 which we have ordered a eco meter for. The diesel motor is running fine but the pulsers attached to the eco meters are not registering this could be because the meters have captured debris in the lines. I have placed an order for 3 more eco meters and 2 filter strainers for them as well. Before leaving I reconnected the breakaway on FP2 which was pulled off while I was on site parked at FP1. Purged and tested for leaks.
