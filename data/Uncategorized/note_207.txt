Following the installation, we performed a calibration of the new meter to ensure its accuracy and reliable operation. After the calibration, we conducted several tests to verify the meter's performance and confirm its readiness for use. All tests were successful, indicating the new meter is functioning as expected.=6e07149e-6a8b-4e08-8264-44f7afb10010 =3fb00ebb-57bc-4107-bc6e-57dc395dc2ef =d10fd214-2bc0-4740-8d6c-e7de572b98a0 11-11.5 10 miles=c9dfe307-509a-4c4f-a86d-87e0481fe35b 11.5-14.25=7a0a3725-ee27-4d35-b0e6-d760254adefd 14.25-=d484d571-1e60-45b6-aa48-780dad758569 230718-0420=9f9392dd-2f53-4425-96dc-9a3f7cb6c407 PO - FWKD2048711=e4e9dea1-4805-4f09-b07a-fbec368c1d58 CK 2723692=ab0376b6-011b-4066-a541-8acab8eae096 2957 W Montague Ave=d4cb1040-5b4c-4155-9310-6cb842e2dd7e North Charleston, SC 29418=54eee292-582c-4daa-bf2a-8d55da494e58 =13580fa0-eefc-45a6-91e0-92f7a17c829c Upon arrival on-site, I checked in with the Manager on Duty. Due to a regional technical issue, I was unable to check into the Interactive Voice Response system and requested assistance from the admin team for check in/check out.=ed526982-f23f-4b9a-973b-9d29bc24cc7a =7107fa9c-a473-4188-ba61-570af7c1c21a The main task was to assess and rectify issues with dispenser 10, which had been impacted by a vehicle. I initially evaluated the software versions, settings, and hardware configuration, following which I purged and reloaded the software on the Unattended Payment Module (UPM) for dispenser 10. I also conducted a detailed assessment of the damage to the hit side of the dispenser, documenting the extent of the damage with photographs to aid in creating a parts quote for the necessary repairs.=d13a2c91-e76a-4dfa-82cf-253a0d058941 =ba31bb5e-2cff-4ba9-bf6a-92eda0b0b932 Subsequently, I examined the configuration of the Card Reader in Dispenser (CRIND) on Fuel Point (FP) 10. I identified an inconsistency in the UPM configuration where the pump ID was incorrectly set to 10. It should have been set to 2 since it operates on a separate channel from the other eight dispensers. Additionally, the Point of Sale (POS) type was incorrectly set to MOC. After rectifying these issues, the CRIND successfully downloaded updates from the POS and resumed normal operation.=62bddfa2-9492-4219-9cf6-3b1496a24ed4 =30985836-2758-4f29-beaa-c308cdacca9d Finally, to confirm the successful resolution of the issue, I conducted an EMV debit transaction test at the pump on FP 10. The test was successful, indicating the dispenser is now functioning correctly. All tests were satisfactory.=c4510049-8a8a-4b92-8e39-ce19b4f64f54 =199884ba-5c69-42d4-a8f7-fd21abbac197 =0650d1d2-c20e-48fc-848c-16b111f48288 =72d5f33e-8f69-4685-a216-c44a0869e53b =702f32db-e582-4b60-a1c3-b16e31df0ab9 =2548ca9a-3116-4fae-a9be-96d94442b6a8 230720-0215=6c89ad5e-9d89-4f38-9fc7-e7bad22a2d12 PO - FWKD2060161=a8160ec4-ec92-402c-b6c8-37acc6c0b0c7 Circle K 2720794=69438712-1843-4e6b-93e1-337668c14137 Summerville SC 29485=a4f659c4-522b-417f-ac8b-e265e74384b6 =e0b6d1d9-ec8a-4269-aeda-3865cb960be1 230719-0289=1a15cbca-0281-4e6b-86a5-8b1603170097 =03c852e2-8e1a-412b-93a0-9a16d8b84374 =6b49efa6-9d56-454b-b7b4-1214e0725700 =80b7b147-b51b-4eb7-b4c8-888aa7cd8740 =80e86b9a-e99e-4a58-a7aa-86929c29d868 =a606b178-b95f-476b-8546-525ddaa63306 =297eda8e-b33b-44ea-b068-0d6614e77b0b =7f63387d-f85f-41fc-833c-a8705d314e48 =7b72dc26-aadd-4198-825a-b70947fb7f81 =d99bc9e0-ca92-45dc-879a-378f53a37b6b =b88c44c7-9180-4262-b8d3-db5cda8fda05 =8c7ae614-6be7-45b6-8b2f-a9e4883e93a3
