I tested dispenser 4 to find it wasn't counting premium. Customer stated he had complaints on 2 and 8 as well. I checked all dispensers due to tampering and found premium 3 and 4 as well as DSL on FP8 had been tampered. In each incident they removed and stole parts of the pulsers requiring replacement of the parts which are sold in sets of 2. I will need 2 sets to repair dispensers. So.ething should be done to secure the dispensers. The seals were broken on all 3 tampered dispensers. =localId_5ec8dbc0439040f7a1e93d003192cd99 =localId_3a70e459c6ea458d8a7e1ed624a18f88 10.75-11.25=localId_b78916447b424b0a94f05561f3eb7e4f 11.25-12.5=localId_0c8bae52ceff4efaa16bde8b28d8bb47 =localId_028794972a80484dba8815d36682a768 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD. The diagnostics showed Q:4 Premium failure of 3.0GPH test as a fluke.[last failure in February] but there was an apparent trend of lower testing pressures of Q:4 by minus 3-4 PSI measured against all the other lines. I replaced the line check valve & verified the higher seating pressures now +1-2 PSI measured against other lines. I monitored the fueling operations for a short time. All test ok. =localId_abe83b9d80d34553b34942264a033f8f =localId_909ccab894314ef3ad5a2a96c3d9471d 12.5-14.25=localId_6f842b66436548b5a2de007b2cb03b88 14.25-16=localId_3ce024a84e1f4d35901b4ee94fad5be2 16-17.25 RTT DH=localId_0b18a1bee5ac42d693dd79bacf16b784 =localId_952535e9d3894e4e8326e21f8432590e =localId_ea4fc3e48f0741cebbffb195d32fc79d VMS 132701=localId_bc08dde1f0bd4c0b9b26bea391400ed5 PO FWKD3216839=localId_ee259bee8d1845e5b5a0a75df84cd9f2 =localId_71bb64b1f34f4115a950aab3d1949c99 711=localId_f19f719e269445099bc11f0951be6e79 8541 w Frey=localId_d1723976d6a04ab88661c28b82a73120 Ft Worth=localId_d6430a18025c499ba112131046554763 =localId_4afb67109b2b4063ad289035df49fb74 =localId_b6e5d7e0219a4e01a569f806f2de0c07 Arrived on-site, had issues checking in on SN and with MOD. I ensure breaker was turned off before checking and disconnecting electrical at the dispenser. I shut down site before construction showed up so that we could load the damaged dispenser to haul it off. Construction replaced and plugged the two shear valves (rft) we also made a temporary barricade. All work complete.
