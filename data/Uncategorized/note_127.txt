The manager told me that the issue with the commander was resolved a couple of days ago. I verified the connection. The site also stated all card readers at the dispensers were in op. I was able to clear the stuck sale on FP3 and reload the C r's to ours to restore functionality. I'll test OK. The site has a bad battery and verified register backup. I went and picked up a battery backup. Returned to site and installed it. All test ok.=localId_7e695b47832e476b9719a6a196245038 =localId_8325a8e74e4247d3b98ddabf8ced733f 13.75-15.75 Terry's motor pull Balch Springs=localId_e71c30b55b654ad3bc82595ed39caf0d 15.75-18=localId_133e855bc819499bbed8359080959bd3 18-19 rttdh=localId_988190ce01204e7f8bd8076a812f46e2 =localId_7bcd1ba5010e4885b65615430d6f8cec Assisted tommy with motor pull at murphys.=localId_35afbe0f65ea44eea1d315243437a3c8 =localId_2e0de4a4ae604b6ea3fb30f42fa0ef79 =localId_c190db3960bb4918aed5b38fe9e3102c
