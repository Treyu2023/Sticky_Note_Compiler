FP 19/20 I put in standalone and tested to find the meter for FP 19REG is leaking from the gaskets like it took a high pressure event such as a hose being pulled off or ran ove by a car, I do not have a C+ meter on my truck and the store is even closed at this time so Iincompleted this and will return in the morning with a meter. I shut off the shear valves for both regular and premium and put the dipenser back online before leaving site.

The CR on FP 11 was hanging on "One Moment Please" some of the configuration for FP 11 was missing. I updated the software on the UPM's which prompted secure device update for both 11/12. I updated the GSoM software on both sides aswell after this did not correct the issue I ordered a replacement GSom for FP 11.

I did not find anything in the CR and it worked normally for me someone must have been able to remove the keychain minicard, prior to my arrival.=12f3e45b-6fba-4bf5-8c48-06af89f76eb1 =a9b063d3-3423-43da-a708-a6f96a2fb31c =c15faae3-cb25-4936-b017-662d4e9f1afa Call 2: The manager stated thatpump 1 was offline 4,12 and 18 were cancelling transactions on customers cards "pin error 4r" and one of them is just saying closed. she also stated that corporate has performed an update to the pumps which is when the issues began. We saw similar issues at other sites where removing the VLU package and re-installing the UPM software celars them up. I perfonmred this procedure on 4,12 18 and 20. this fixed all but 20. FP 20 and 1 were not on my tickets but I asked the mansger if she wanted me to look at them as well and she did, she also asked that if I was going to reboot the Tiger to do it overnight. I contacted RTSS and he agreed with me in that the next step after the repairs made today to other devices on the network would be to reboot the power on FP 1 and then the tiger box. I communicated this to the shift manager who was still here at this point and collectively we decided that they are going to reboot it tonight and if 1 and 20 still don't work, the site will create a separate ticket fot them at that time. All test ok.
