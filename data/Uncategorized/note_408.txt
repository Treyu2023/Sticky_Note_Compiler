The issue was not with the passport POS, but with several dispensers the site called in. I made networking changes to 5,613&14. I could not activate the display on FP 14. It was damaged and bent so I replaced and activated the 10.4" CRIND display after repairs all FPs came online and were working. FP4 had a leaking nozzle so I replaced that aswell.
