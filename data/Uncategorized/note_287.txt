Together we worked to try and resolve the issue including  retracing alot of troubleshooting steps previously done, we contacted Micheal with GVR TAC and still were unable to resolve the issue. Ads we were wrapping it up we realized one of the ethernet cables running from the CCP board was going into the store. we traced it to a patch panel that redirects it to the sites Managed switch which we were unable to see past due to PCI compliance. We determined there has to be an IP conflict behind the switch. At this point we contacted their helpdesk and forwarded information to their IT department who are going to look into it and reach out to us, when they do we will return to ensure all issues are resolved.=aad12b87-6e94-47b3-9163-22edb7e9971b =a3f53761-5215-4694-9f83-0760372508cf =72739273-be4e-489b-93a0-fc4eaaaa55f8 16 - 17.5 RTT=abb88b51-29dc-46a5-9856-f24d193cbd61 17.5 - 19.25 RTL=5d3ae357-e874-48cc-8614-8eb96f03d490 19.25 - 19.5 RTTDH=f71b714c-f3de-404a-9c02-ceab7324612f =9c12bce4-2388-45b6-b2f2-508e86ec1948 RT 2567=4c665d2e-b938-41d2-94d9-9a1367db5429 371 E Stacy RD=5e7fa9e8-03ef-49a8-8854-3148a1735c36 Fairview=05747fa3-4ccc-4666-bf98-99fe749747cd =c2b3c857-ccd7-4c07-8019-422a6c7691fb 131879=f3757db9-0a51-4b1a-9b44-a914f35cc923 188249630=9848e2d8-66b6-40cd-8291-9a3aecc2a404 =0d7a6ad0-d791-4985-8014-a6113d6bcb7c FP1 5150 error code tried removing and cleaning the PPu but did not fix problem ordering part,
