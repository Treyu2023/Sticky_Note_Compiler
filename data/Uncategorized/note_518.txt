Alfonso a terchnician was on site performing an upgrade removing the tiger and installing a panther. Shane and I worked to calibrate the site NCR tech worked on the Tiger till he found out his panther board was bad. He stated that another technician with another board would be sent out tonight to get site up. I commissioned the dispensers after the site calibration. All test ok.=044b4e1d-cb61-4654-a4b1-810a025db9db =2bb8b402-03ef-4ddd-a832-34c1fbd2c55c =69e9f1ff-92f3-49ba-96d4-205cd58970ef commissioning number 11237934=2547940c-cf9e-41a0-874a-e193de79b0be =405fcbdd-bddf-47fc-8838-ff413ce673bc 001744908=e71c5614-4ef6-4bbb-9766-132eda60ff52 =becf383e-ad03-47e1-b6c8-3db0cfd9066e 72,0,1,0,0,0,100;=7403a92d-c567-422f-8500-20fadb454c02 72,0,2,0,0,0,065;=aa46c0a1-c270-465d-b220-19e54e6740dd 72,0,3,0,0,0,000;=5472d43e-346d-4fa1-b15d-91e56e8b9094 =e2cf38a7-7574-4545-9eee-f2bcb11fd246 90,0,0,0,0,0,17;=513ba052-7992-4539-b916-d8452b6bb976 =b82e189d-eefd-4452-9046-bacca1466c4e =c80bb2d3-bbfd-48cb-8f51-1ade674f886c =107425f4-8b80-43a0-95af-38e862f11a13ON CALL=e2f050b2-f926-4add-b59b-ecdabb82347e =418fe713-6e03-4a8c-9315-7182b43ec21a23.5 - 0.75 OTT=1998b2e9-5667-4494-b4a2-d05ba890a1040.75 -1.75 OTL=a1309393-e7a8-4d81-938c-2cd2677301ae1.75 - 230AM  Drive Home=c11dbd8b-79bf-4980-b698-a39a61b5789ePO - 180778945=8eaf271d-b193-4fd1-96f1-e8820601b4ad =f12dc701-0cb5-4467-8288-d6d6c06b50d37940 Lebanon Rd=22030918-1944-478d-9c8e-7fff09c4bba4Frisco=4f381618-757e-4050-a8ab-aa9fd7f0b410 =c58f9ecb-01ed-4ae0-a844-55d7a7b8ce58 Arrived on site and checked in with MOD, investigated the issue with the Regular STP to find the line fault alarm cleared with acknowledgement. The coresponding MAG VFC was set to mechanical leak detecting on the jumper bank. In fact all but one of the MAG VFC's were set this way. I made appropriate configuration changes, cleared the alarms and performed a line test on all lines. I then placed the dispensers back in service. All test ok.
