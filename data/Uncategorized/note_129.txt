My first task was to replace the pump control node. After its successful installation, I proceeded to program and calibrate the newly installed node. At this stage, I was able to dispense in standalone mode. However, the dispenser was not coming online despite my attempts.=d4aea960-c2aa-466f-91ed-6ad83e47c414 =ff93a7ae-9619-453c-abba-749837d80220 In order to identify the issue, I thoroughly examined the (SSoM), the field wiring, and cabling configuration. Despite these efforts, the problem remained unclear.=71f9bbb7-4334-468f-94bf-419193ae21f3 =523cbcbf-5764-4a9a-85b0-70449a049491 To further narrow down the potential issues, I bypassed the (DCM) which allowed the dispenser to come online and accept prices. This indicated to me that the DCM was likely the source of the problem. As a response, I replaced the DCM and SSoM, hoping this would fully resolve the issue.=45058773-078c-4844-9b84-f3b8dfc1bdf8 =95d59b23-243d-486b-8a45-cdb04350d058 Upon completing the replacement process, I found that the dispenser was working, however, the card reader in dispenser (CRIND) was not. Despite trying every combination of DCM and SSoM from the available parts, the CRIND issue remained. My assessment is that the DCM+SSoM unit I had was dead on arrival (DOA).=b532d55e-cdb5-4ac6-a5fe-896658857ce9 =388e35c0-4862-4607-a876-b72d489448d5 In order to fully resolve this issue, I will need to return with the necessary replacement parts.
