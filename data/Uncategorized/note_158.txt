During my conversation with the owner, I discovered that the EFS fleet cards are commercial WEX accounts that offer driver cash advances. However, my fleet WEX card was functioning properly. To diagnose the issue further, Raj provided me with a customer's card, which generated an error code of "invalid Merchant ID" regardless of whether the transaction was conducted at the POS or card reader outside. I immediately contacted Exxon and requested them to modify the card tables, after which we performed a PDL. However, the error persisted.=092eb7fe-d2af-4dd7-9b2d-854ade130339 =1a5cd72e-0b3b-4624-8179-d4497988ffcf I referred to Verifone documentation and checked the system and commercial fueling positions, making necessary changes, but the issue persisted. I then contacted Verifone, and they suggested that it could be an account-level entitlements issue and referred me to Buypass. After discussing with Buypass, they directed me to the Rep Account Manager for Exxon, who explained that the jobber would have to make the necessary changes to the account. I relayed this information to Raj, the owner, and asked him to contact Davenport, who is currently looking into it.=7ebe2764-6234-42e2-8af1-c4ade56dd000 =3eec9cfe-e6e9-4b40-82cb-2ffef8f54175 Furthermore, I resolved the pump issue on another ticket by power cycling the dispenser. Also, I made adjustments to the customer's manual fuel function as per the manager's request to make it a manual credit button, and all tests were successful. =5295121c-44e7-4818-bfe5-c01668647e55 =16dce3b3-ba77-4291-8aaf-c4e17b557438 Verifone case # 08717469=84f1ec6e-604f-4765-ad3d-0384b89b4214 Exxon case # 681228613001=dcf6378c-d6c1-427b-ac4f-321985489f30 =ce7aab92-5017-4d6f-a8d1-741ac589dfb7 =5c6871e8-8fe2-4c96-8be8-66075e33e99b Buypass Omaha 800-228-0210=6f1c25ab-c69e-4cd0-9faa-2c55ea4806db =2032a15b-bbaf-486b-a0e9-c32b0a15fb45 entitlements issue potentially=98ac56f6-84f6-4218-af8a-4a534674fb2f =1ebd7709-ec04-455c-a961-714bdcd9f55e 2766509915=136e218a-4fbe-4317-a391-a4b74cf2004b =6ee8839c-4aa7-4625-94ae-0a20547e2144 =0bd58208-1a61-41ea-97fd-e6cc8ca2ea21 =91ee4bfc-773d-4969-8738-6184326e650a =7d804eed-9be2-44bb-b154-b16653b00d1d =8e5b2e21-5325-4333-b738-5cfcabc01e0e =b15f1d53-5c85-41aa-8200-b0cb0c9955b6 =e9d69e5f-c008-4d6e-a969-a6466ec032da =8bf4e15c-0c50-4e26-ac7a-aef34538a07d
