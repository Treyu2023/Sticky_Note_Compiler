I installed the new Pin pad on register 1 and moved the old one tw register two. The PIN Pad came up to a black screen. I donwloaded fresh software and screapped the software on my thumb drive and reloaded it. It returned to a black screen again. The software used was outilined in the release notes for Commander exxon 3.12.21 that the site is running and was VP version 4.07.04. I got with admin team and had SB bring a rebuilt PIN Pad to the site, this pin pad out of the box was stating "Maintenance required UT" afterwards we were forced to move the pin pads back and reinstall the originals. The EBT function would not work after setting up a MOP button with the proper MOP code per verifone of "20_EBT" we contacted Exxon and Buypass twice and performed table loads and callced verifone back. On the second call with Verifone we were able to get the EBT working after some trial and error and found that the proper payment code for EBT SNAP is "21 EBT_FS" this allowed the customer to process ebt transactions through the viper pay payment terminal attached to the commander (MX915). unfortunately the PLUs the site is using do not have the Food Stamp check box checked so he will need to update his price books. we left the Foodstamp department and Manual FS MOP active for him to use in the meantime. All work complete at this time, will need to return to install a new MX915 once we can get one. I did not collect on this trip for that reason per SB.=dd4c3ab2-8dc1-4f67-9a3c-cbf3f769d0cc =e7af3f09-ccfd-41fd-ba9a-b3d3040ff41c =722e233c-665d-456c-99fc-9340d072e09a T19.5-20.75  Miles62=c0d4b598-07b7-4490-9884-26f5cc50160a L20.75-21.75=ecdf6119-ee3c-46be-a4b8-4ec29c6ebeb8 T21.75-0.5=e42a7b06-38e6-4c05-bab9-304ffc95b4bf hutchens petroleum=0cd8271a-2687-4860-aecf-8f6f4248d26f 155 floyd pike=2b1aab46-6f9e-4073-ac33-ad4dc25a31f4 hillsville VA =3534CB53-A28C-473B-A175-4F4819DAFD1F =18B85336-03BE-4217-AB73-0EBBBD933CB7 Arrived on-site, checked in with MOD. I immediately found the ethernet cable plugged into the Client was not clicked in all the way due to cable tension issue. I corrected the issue and tried to initialize replication from the server. This failed multiple times so I called cybera to confirm ethernet communication were good.  The register was offline for some time with intermittent connectivity and corrupted something in the database on the client during read/write cycles. I clean imaged the client and re-initialized replication which brought it back up. The site asked me to look at the printer on FP 3 it keeps saying out of paper. I removed the printer and cleaned it and re-installed it. This cleared up the errors. All test ok.
