Before proceeding with the module installation, which necessitated a temporary shutdown of the forecourt, I ensured all troubleshooting steps were thoroughly examined.=681cbb99-ac0c-4878-8e8b-e6ec605022af =c6386c87-dcae-4fd1-a891-3284f6addca3 During the forecourt shutdown, I embarked on diagnostic tests which involved placing one dispenser in standalone mode. This was instrumental in verifying the correct relay engagement. A challenging aspect of this task was the need to trace wires extending from the tank monitor to the relay system. Notably, these wires navigate through flex within the ceiling and utilize a breaker panel as a conduit. It's critical to mention that such a setup is not aligned with standard electrical codes, suggesting an imminent need for a review by a certified electrician.=d8fcdb09-1be8-441d-bbff-411b32ffcbcf =9edaf302-c52d-40b0-a653-f86c53e68bcd My in-depth investigation revealed that the orange wire from the Veeder Root transitions to brown within the trough right before it connects to the relay. While the pump sense mechanism is functional and effectively detects when the motor operates, the origin of the hot wire remains undetermined due to the complexity of the trough and time constraints.=533dbdc1-7cf9-417d-a701-05b897cafcc0 =70130ea3-11a1-4a97-9790-38fa4afb6202 After replacing and testing the module, I was able to produce printouts which indicated a decline in the volume in Tank 3 for Regular fuel. Monitoring this over an extended period confirmed the volume drop in Tank 3, an observation that was previously absent.=6eeb7b25-185e-46c8-aae5-38efe42d7873 =04fa6e39-4831-4817-b74a-15975e3c7c87 Conclusion:=ea373ff6-099d-48ed-84f2-307865b8d94a The on-site visit was productive, leading to the successful identification and documentation of volume drops in Tank 3. However, certain challenges like wire tracing were time-consuming, and the unconventional wiring method through the breaker panel necessitates attention from an electrical professional. Future visits should consider these intricacies for comprehensive system optimization.=d082b5d7-edb7-4684-884f-f8e38c4f8bf9 =d49e5427-12f4-40c0-b714-3b3b7e6fd75b =fad67a66-6ced-497f-819a-1b8d69e41f09 =8a1c6ea3-fddd-4dd5-a57d-a54909740d24
