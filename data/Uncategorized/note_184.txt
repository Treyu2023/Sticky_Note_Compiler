FP16, I put in standalone, tested flow rate and shear valve holding. I replaced the filter and tested the flow rate and checked for leaks. I also performed the same procedures on 11/12 before realizing it was all reg filters at the site. I replaced all 10 regular filters and checked flow rates. All test ok.=localId_4664339e6b534b02b737b1f7e7d31616 =localId_4603345e01b84c08b52745dbd3712c79 =localId_479e9d22b1a64fe299dce5a2096f430c 13.75-15.5=localId_c728c451c46b402781cea42c83042330 15.5-16.25=localId_049cb9a42a584370ba29475e6b5c9200 16.25-18.5 end=localId_c7b7196411d344d5acb2c904f01fc92d 138988=localId_ec682ac540bf4717a0d1b8ec34316511 210698532=localId_b4ac835ca0924c8f92606b2829613758 Racetrac=localId_644281a0b0af4a42a58b19468c53b0c3 6901 Wesley=localId_78e8d85954d8435d866bde1312951acf Greenville=localId_3cb5d13f09d149fca5d76842fae28558 =localId_005670ae47f544a884c24bdbc7514dc9 Arrived on-site, checked in on SC and with MOD.  The site's Back Office PC was working. I spoke with the Damund at RT Systems helpdesk, he reviewed the ticket and explained that the back office PC is scheduled to receive an upgraded hard drive. There is no tracking information on the ticket yet, also no package has been received by the site. I am incompleting the ticket at this time, will return after parts arrive.
